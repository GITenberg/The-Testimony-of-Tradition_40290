<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>A large portion of this work has already appeared in
the form of a series of articles contributed to the <i>Archæological
Review</i> (Aug.-Oct., 1889, and Jan., 1890), but these
have here undergone some alteration and have been supplemented
to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>With regard to the correctness of the deductions drawn
in the following pages from the facts and traditions there
stated, there may easily be a difference of opinion. And
indeed one writer, Mr. Alfred Nutt, in the course of a very
learned dissertation on the Development of the Fenian
or Ossianic Saga,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has expressed his dissent from the
theories advanced in the articles referred to. It would be
out of place to enter here into a consideration of the grounds
of Mr. Nutt's objections, even if that did not demand an
undue amount of space; but it may be pointed out that the
articles upon which his criticism is based only state very
partially the case which even the following more enlarged
version is far from presenting fully. But what is of much
greater importance is, that the theory which I have here
endeavoured to set forth has the peculiar advantage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
possessing a tangible test of its worth. What that test is
will be readily seen by every reader. If the result of future
archæological excavations should be to confirm tradition
(as it is needless to say the writer of these pages believes
will be the case), the question then will be one, not of interpreting
tradition so that it may square with current beliefs,
but of modifying or altering these beliefs, where they are
distinctly in disagreement with tradition.</p>

<h2>THE TESTIMONY OF TRADITION.</h2>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>In one of an interesting series of papers on "Scottish, Shetlandic,
and Germanic Water Tales,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Dr. Karl Blind remarks
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>It is in the Shetland Tales that we hear a great deal of creatures
partly more than human, partly less so, which appear in the interchangeable
shape of men and seals. They are said to have often married
ordinary mortals, so that there are, even now, some alleged descendants
of them, who look upon themselves as superior to common people.</p>

<p>In Shetland, and elsewhere in the North, the sometimes animal-shaped
creatures of this myth, but who in reality are human in a higher
sense, are called <i>Finns</i>. Their transfiguration into seals seems to be more
a kind of deception they practise. For the males are described as most
daring boatmen, with powerful sweep of the oar, who chase foreign
vessels on the sea. At the same time they are held to be deeply versed
in magic spells and in the healing art, as well as in soothsaying. By
means of a "skin" which they possess, the men and the women among
them are able to change themselves into seals. But on shore, after having
taken off their wrappage, they are, and behave like, real human
beings. Anyone who gets hold of their protecting garment has the
Finns in his power. Only by means of the skin can they go back to
the water. Many a Finn woman has got into the power of a Shetlander
and borne children to him; but if a Finn woman succeeded in reobtaining
her sea-skin, or seal-skin, she escaped across the water. Among
the older generation in the Northern isles persons are still sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
heard of who boast of hailing from Finns; and they attribute to themselves
a peculiar luckiness on account of that higher descent.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Tales of the descent of certain families from water beings of a magic
character are very frequent in the ... North. In Ireland such myths
also occur sporadically. In Wales ... the origin from mermen or
mermaids is often charged as a reproach upon unhappy people; and
rows originate from such assertions. In Shetland the reverse is, or
was, the case. There the descendants of Finns have been wont to boast
of their origin; regarding themselves as favourites of Fortune....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But who are the Finns of the Shetlandic story? Are they simply a
poetical transfiguration of finny forms of the flood? Or can the Ugrian
race of the Finns, which dwells in Finland, in the high north of Norway,
and in parts of Russia, have something to do with those tales in which a
Viking-like character is unmistakable?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Repeated investigations have gradually brought me to the conviction
that the Finn or Seal stories contain a combination of the mermaid myth
with a strong historical element&mdash;that the Finns are nothing else than
a fabulous transmogrification of those Norse "sea-dogs," who from eld
have penetrated into the islands round Scotland, into Scotland itself, as
well as into Ireland. "Old sea-dog" is even now a favourite expression
for a weather-beaten, storm-tossed skipper&mdash;a perfect seal among the wild
waves.</p>

<p>The assertion of a "higher" origin of still living persons from Finns
... would thus explain itself as a wildly legendary remembrance of
the descent from the blood of Germanic conquerors. The "skin" wherewith
the Finns change themselves magically into sea-beings I hold to be
their armour, or coat of mail. Perhaps that coat itself was often made
of seal-skin, and then covered with metal rings, or scales, as we see it in
Norman pictures; for instance, on the Bayeux tapestry. The designation
of Norwegian and Danish conquerors, in Old Irish history, as "scaly
monsters," certainly fits in with this hypothesis.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But however the Finn name may be explained etymologically, at all
events Norway appears in the Shetland tales, and in the recollection of
the people there, as the home of the "Finns." And this home&mdash;as I see
from an interesting bit of folk-lore before me&mdash;is evidently in the south
of Norway....</p>

<p>"Before coming to this important point, I may mention a Shetlandic
spell-song ... [which] refers to the cure of the toothache; the Finn
appearing therein as a magic medicine-man:&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
A Finn came ow'r fa Norraway,<br />
Fir ta pit töth-ache away&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Oot o' da flesh an' oot o' da bane;<br />
Oot o' da sinew an' oot o' da skane;<br />
Oot o' da skane an' into da stane;<br />
An dare may do remain!<br />
An dare may do remain!<br />
An dare may do remain!
</div>

<p>In this, though not strictly and correctly, alliterative song, the Finn is
not an animal-shaped creature of the deep, but a man, a charm-working
doctor from Norway.... Presently we will, however, see that the Finns
of the Shetlandic stories are martial pursuers of ships, to whom ransom
must be paid in order to get free from them. This cannot apply ...
to a mere marine animal or sea monster: for what should such a creature
do with ransom money?... As to their animal form, Mr. George
Sinclair writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sea monsters are for most part called 'Finns' in Shetland. They
have the power to take any shape of any marine animal, as also that of
human beings. They were wont to <i>pursue boats at sea</i>, and it was
dangerous in the extreme to say <i>anything against them</i>. I have heard
that <i>silver money was thrown overboard to them</i> to prevent their doing
any damage to the boat. In the seal-form they came ashore every ninth
night to dance on the sands. They would then cast off their skins, and
act <i>just like men and women</i>. They could not, however, return to the
sea without their skins&mdash;they were <i>simply human beings</i>, as an old song
says:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
"'I am a man upo' da land;<br />
I am a selkie i' da sea.<br />
An' whin I'm far fa every strand,<br />
My dwelling is in Shöol Skerry.'"
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There are many such folk-tales in the northern Thule. A man, we
learn, always gets possession of the Finn woman by seizing the skin she
has put off. One of these stories says that the captured Finn woman
would often leave her husband to enjoy his slumber alone, and go down
amongst the rocks to converse with her Finn one: but the inquisitive
people who listened could not understand a single word of the conversation.
She would, it is said, return after such interviews with briny and
swollen eyes.</p>

<p>The human family of this Finn were human in all points except in
hands, which resembled web feet. Had the foolish man who was her
husband burnt or destroyed the skin, the Finn woman could never have
escaped. But the man had the skin hidden, and it was found by one of
the bairns, who gave it to his mother. Thereupon she fled; and it is said
that she cried at parting with her family very bitterly. The little ones
were the only human beings she cared for. When the father came home,
he found the children in tears, and on learning what had happened,
bounded through the standing corn to the shore, where he only arrived in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
time to see, to his grief, his good wife shaking flippers and embracing an
ugly brute of a seal. She cried:&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
"Blissins' be wi' de,<br />
Baith de and da bairns!<br />
Bit do kens, da first love<br />
Is aye da best!"
</div>

<p>whereupon she disappeared with her Finn husband and lover.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>... I here give what Mr. Robert Sinclair says of the capture of
Finn brides by Shetlanders:</p>

<p>"Each district, almost, has its own version of a case where a young
Shetlander had married a female Finn. They were generally caught at
their toilet in the tide-mark, having doffed the charmed covering, and
being engaged in dressing their flowing locks while the enamoured youth,
by some lucky stroke, secured the skin, rendering the owner a captive
victim of his passion. Thus it was that whole families of a mongrel race
sprang up, according to tradition. The Finn women were said to <i>make
good housewives</i>. Yet there was generally a longing after some previous
attachment; if ever a chance occurred of recovering the essential dress,
no newly formed ties of kindred could prevent escape and return to
former pleasures. This was assiduously guarded against on the one side,
and watched on the other; but, as the story goes, female curiosity and
cunning were always more than a match for male care and caution; and
the Finn woman always got the slip. One or two of these female Finns
were said to have the power to conjure up from the deep a superior breed
of horned cattle; and these always throve well. I have seen some
pointed out to me as the offspring of these 'sea-kye.'"</p>

<p>In answer to my question, the Shetland friend lays great stress on the
fact of the Finn woman being wholly distinct from the Mermaid....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Of the Finn man my informant says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stories of the Norway Finns were rife in my younger days. These
were said to be a race of creatures of <i>human origin</i> no doubt, but
possessed of some power of enchantment by which they could, with the
use of a charmed seal-skin, become in every way, to all appearance, a
veritable seal; only <i>retaining their human intelligence</i>. It seems that
any seal-skin could not do; each <i>must have their specially prepared skin</i>
before they could assume the aquatic life. But then they could live for
years in the sea. Yet they were not reckoned as belonging to the natural
class of 'amphibia.' As man or seal they were simply Finns, and could
play their part well in either element. Their feats were marvellous. It
was told me as sheer truth that they could <i>pull across to Bergen</i>&mdash;nearly
300 miles&mdash;in a few hours, and that, while ordinary mortals were asleep,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
they could make the return voyage. Nine miles for every warp (stroke
of the oar) was the traditional speed...."</p>

<p>Here, then, the Finns are men of human origin; remaining intelligent
men in their sea-dog raiment; coming from Norway; not swimming
like marine animals, but rowing between Shetland and Norway&mdash;namely,
to the town of Bergen, which lies in the southern ... part of Norway.
As strong men at sea, they row with magic quickness.... Each one of
them ... must have his specially prepared skin.... There is
nothing here of the swimming and dipping down of a seal.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have followed Dr. Karl Blind so far. But, while
recognizing the value of his statements and comments up
to this point, it is necessary to give only a modified assent
to some of his subsequent deductions, and to flatly deny the
correctness of others; because his researches in "Shetlandic
folk-lore" have clearly been too limited in their extent, or
rather, he has omitted to check those traditions by any
possible contemporary records. Some of those tales were
received from a Shetland woman "who strongly believed in
the Finns, and declared herself to be a descendant of them....
She was, she said, the 'fifth from the Finns,' and she
attributed great luckiness to herself, although she was as
poor as poor could be." One of her stories is of her father's
great-grandfather; and as this ancestor of the woman's is
not spoken of as a "Finn," it would seem that she was
"fifth from the Finns" through another branch of her lineage.
But, at any rate, this progenitor in the fourth degree cannot
have belonged to a much later period than the middle of the
eighteenth century. However, we shall see these Shetland
Finns more plainly described if we turn to the latter part of
the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In "A Description of the Isles of Orkney," written by the
Rev. James Wallace, A.M., Minister of Kirkwall, about the
year 1688, one reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Sometime about this Country [Orkney] are seen these Men which
are called <i>Finnmen</i>; In the year 1682 one was seen sometime sailing,
sometime Rowing up and down in his little Boat at the south end of
the Isle of <i>Eda</i>, most of the people of the Isle flocked to see him, and
when they adventured to put out a Boat with men to see if they could
apprehend him, he presently fled away most swiftly: And in the Year
1684, another was seen from <i>Westra</i>, and for a while after they got few
or no Fishes, for they have this Remark here, that these <i>Finnmen</i> drive
away the fishes from the place to which they come.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>Again, in Brand's "Brief Description of Orkney, Zetland,
etc." (1701), it is stated:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>There are frequently <i>Fin-men</i> seen here upon the Coasts, as one
about a year ago on <i>Stronsa</i>, and another within these few Months
on <i>Westra</i>, a gentleman with many others in the Isle looking on him
nigh to the shore, but when any endeavour to apprehend them they flee
away most swiftly; Which is very strange, that one man sitting in his
little Boat, should come some hundred of Leagues, from their own
Coasts, as they reckon <i>Finland</i> to be from <i>Orkney</i>; It may be thought
wonderfull how they live all that time, and are able to keep the Sea so
long. His Boat is made of Seal-skins, or some kind of leather, he also
hath a Coat of Leather upon him, and he sitteth in the middle of his
Boat, with a little Oar in his hand, Fishing with his Lines: And when
in a storm he seeth the high surge of a wave approaching, he hath a
way of sinking his Boat, till the wave pass over, lest thereby he should
be overturned. The Fishers here observe that these <i>Finmen</i> or <i>Finland-men</i>,
by their coming drive away the Fishes from the Coasts. One
of their Boats is kept as a Rarity in the <i>Physicians Hall at Edinburgh</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>This last fact was first stated by Wallace (1688; previously
quoted), who remarks:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of their Boats sent from Orkney to Edinburgh is to be seen in
the Physitians hall with the Oar and the Dart he makes use of for
killing Fish, [and it is stated by Mr. John Small, M.A., &amp;c., in his
edition<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of this book that the boat spoken of was "afterwards presented
to the University Museum, now incorporated with the Museum of
Science and Art, Edinburgh"; and a note appended to the second
edition also states that "there is another of their boats in the Church
of Burra in Orkney."]</p></blockquote>

<p>Wallace's book has also a note ascribed to the author's
son, to the following effect:</p>

<blockquote><p>I must acknowledge it seems a little unaccountable how these <i>Finn-men</i>
should come on this coast, but they must probably be driven by
storms from home, and cannot tell, when they are any way at sea, how
to make their way home again; they have this advantage, that be the
Seas never so boisterous, their boats being made of Fish Skins, are so
contrived that he can never sink, but is like a Sea-gull swimming on the
top of the watter. His shirt he has is so fastned to the Boat, that no
water can come into his Boat to do him damage, except when he pleases
to untye it....</p></blockquote>

<p>There is, it will be seen, some difference of opinion as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the place whence these Finn-men came. The Shetlandic
folk-lore indicates Bergen, on the south-western coast of
Norway; Brand regards Finland as their home; while
Wallace takes a still wider range. This last writer (who is
the first in point of time) says this of them:&mdash;"These <i>Finn-men</i>
seem to be some of these people that dwell about the
<i>Fretum Davis</i> [Davis Straits], a full account of whom may be
seen in the natural and moral History of the <i>Antilles</i>, Chap.
18." At first sight, and according to modern nomenclature,
the connection between the Antilles and Davis Straits seems
very remote. But it must be remembered that the traditional
country of "Antilla," or the "Antilles," probably included
the modern Atlantic seaboard of North America; and that,
when that territory was invaded by the Norsemen of the
tenth century, it was found to contain a population of exactly
the same description as those "Finn" races&mdash;people of dwarfish
stature, who traversed their bays and seas in skin-covered
skiffs.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> However, Wallace's theory is obviously untenable.
It is most improbable that any Eskimo of Davis Straits
would attempt the trans-Atlantic passage in his tiny <i>kayak</i>,
supporting life on the voyage by eating raw such fish as he
might catch. Indeed, the feat is almost an impossibility.
Moreover, it is quite clear that those Finn-men were voluntary
and frequent visitors to the Orkneys, and (more
especially) to the Shetlands; and the "Fin-land" from which
they came is stated by the Shetlanders to have been no
further off than Bergen, on the Norwegian coast.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It is quite evident that "the Finns of the Shetlandic
story" formed a branch of the "Ugrian race of the Finns";
and that some of them "came ow'r fa Norraway"&mdash;whether
as "wizards," or as fishermen, or as pirates (for they figure in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
all these characters). The description of their skin-covered
canoes is of itself quite sufficient to show that those "Finns"
of Orkney and Shetland were of the Eskimo races. So that
those "sea-skins," without which the captive Finn women
could not make their escape, were simply their canoes. And
the exaggerated stories of the speed with which the Finns
could cross from Shetland to Bergen have their foundation in
the fact that those little skiffs can be propelled through the
water at such a rate that the hunted Finn was enabled to
"flee away most swiftly" from the clumsier boats of his
pursuers. The speed of the kayak is very clearly illustrated
in an account of the doings of one of "these people that
dwell about the <i>Fretum Davis</i>," who was brought to this
country in 1816, and who, in that year, showed the great
superiority of his skiff in a contest with a six-oared whale-boat
at Leith. "He paddled his canoe from the inner
harbour," says the <i>Scots Magazine</i> of that year (p. 656),
"round the Martello Tower and back in sixteen minutes,
against a whale-boat with six stout rowers, and evidently
shewed his ability to outsail his opponents by the advantages
he frequently gave them, and which he redeemed as often as he
chose." This, it will be seen, was simply a repetition of the
scenes described a hundred and twenty years earlier, in the
Orkney and Shetland groups; the chief difference being that
those earlier Eskimos had their home in Europe, and not in
any part of the western hemisphere. Of course, the Shetland
belief that the Finns could "pull across to Bergen in a few
hours," and that "nine miles for every warp (stroke of the
oar) was the traditional speed," is obviously an exaggeration.
But the distance (which is nearer 200 than "300" miles)
might almost be traversed in the course of the long midsummer
day of those northern latitudes&mdash;by such seafarers,
and in such craft.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>But, while the "seal-skin" of the traditional Finn was
primarily his skin kayak, it is likely enough that he is also
remembered as the wearer of a seal-skin garment; and that
from this has arisen the confusion of ideas regarding this
magic "skin." "His boat is made of seal-skins, or some
kind of leather," says Brand, in describing the Finn-man;
but he adds that "<i>he</i> also hath a coat of leather upon him."
And Dr. Wallace tells us that the Finns "have this advantage,
that be the seas never so boisterous, their boats being made of
fish skins, are so contrived that he can never sink, but is like
a sea-gull swimming on the top of the water." And he continues:
"His shirt he has is so fastened to the boat that no
water can come into his boat to do him damage, except when
he pleases to untie it." Dr. Rink, in referring to the kayaks
of those "Finn-men" who inhabit the regions surrounding
the Fretum Davis, uses similar terms: "The deck alone was
not sufficient; the sea washing over it would soon fill the
kayak through the hole, in which its occupant is sitting, if
his clothing did not at the same time close the opening
around him. This adaptation of the clothing is tried by
degrees in various ways throughout the Eskimo countries,
but it does not attain its perfection except in Greenland,
where it forms in connection with the kayak itself a water-tight
cover for the whole body excepting the face."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But, in
making this last statement, Dr. Rink is speaking of the nineteenth-century
representatives of this race; and in ignorance
of the fact that the "Eskimos" of the North Sea had long
ago realized the necessity for this waterproof covering.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>This waterproof "shirt" is also specially mentioned in
connection <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
with the Finn kayak that the two Scotch writers
of the seventeenth century refer to. Wallace, it will be remembered,
says of the Orkney Finn-men that "one of their boats
sent from Orkney to Edinburgh is to be seen in the Physicians'
Hall, with the oar and the dart he makes use of for killing
fish." At the time when Wallace wrote, in or about the year
1688, there is no doubt that the boat was so deposited. But,
although the second writer, Brand, makes the same statement,
it is evident that he only did so on the authority of his
predecessor. Because, four or five years before Brand's book
appeared, the Finnman's kayak had been presented by the
Royal College of Physicians to the University of Edinburgh.
The way in which the Physicians' College had obtained the
boat was through the president of the college, Sir Andrew
Balfour, eminent as a physician, botanist and naturalist, and
a great collector of all sorts of curiosities. At his death in
1694, his collection passed to the University of Edinburgh,
by bequest. But, for one reason or another, the Finnman's
boat still remained in the Physicians' College. This will be
seen from the following extract from the Minute Book of
that College, which records the transfer of the boat to the
University of Edinburgh, two years after Sir Andrew Balfour's
death. The date of the Minute is 24th September,
1696.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "The qlk [whilk] day y<sup>e</sup>   colledge considering y<sup>t</sup> dr

<p>From this extract we gain the additional information that
the "Shirt" or "Coat of Leather" of the "barbarous man"
himself had also found its way to the University Museum of
Edinburgh; presumably through Sir Andrew Balfour also,
or perhaps through his friend and colleague, Sir Robert

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>Anyone familiar with the shape of the long, narrow, skin-covered
skiff of the Eskimo (which, as has just been pointed
out, is completely "decked," with the exception of the round
aperture in the middle, where the rower sits&mdash;his legs being
thrust in front of him, underneath the "deck,") will see that
when the Finn had fastened his seal-skin garment to the
sides of the aperture, he and his boat were one. Thus not
only could "no water come into his Boat to do him damage,"
but he appeared (to people unacquainted with his anatomy)
as some amphibious seal-man&mdash;"a selkie i' da sea," as the
Shetland rhyme goes. This resemblance is even further
borne out by the ability of the kayaker to overset himself
and his kayak, and then to re-appear on the surface of the
water, without either himself or his skiff suffering any injury,
as both were impervious to water. This feat is evidently
a delight to the kayaker, and the Eskimo already referred to
as having displayed his skill at Leith in the year 1816, performed
this man&#0339;uvre many times, to the great astonishment
of the onlookers. Thus the Finnman of the North Sea,
who presumably indulged in this amusement, like his representatives
in Greenland to-day, was thereby rendered still
more like a creature of the deep, "a perfect seal among the
wild waves," as Dr. Karl Blind remarks.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>It is to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
apparently amphibious nature of this peculiar people, that
one may trace much&mdash;if not all&mdash;that has been recorded of
mermen and mermaids; who, in other words, were seamen
and seamaids. The conventional mer-man is portrayed as
visible above water from the waist upward. And that the
kayaker presents a similar appearance may be seen from a
description given of an Eskimo flotilla by one who has had
personal experience of the Hudson's Bay regions,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> wherein
it is stated that, at some distance from the land, "the low
kayaks" of the Eskimos, being almost quite flush with the
water, "it seemed as if their occupants were actually seated
on the water." The accompanying spirited sketch by Mr.
A. R. Carstensen of a modern Eskimo, as he appears "when
the waves come upon him with all their fury," helps much to
make one realize the appearance of the Orkney Finnman,
whether in storm or in calm.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is easy to see how a race
of "<i>zee-woners</i>" such as these could gradually become remembered
as an actually amphibious people.</p>

<p>Those legendary mermaids who are described as using
combs and mirrors were plainly allied to these Finn-women.
It is manifest that no amphibious woman (the possibility of
whose existence is not here denied) would carry a mirror and
a comb about with her; or that she&mdash;whose chief element
was the water&mdash;would be for ever engaged in the mad task of
arranging hair which every plunge in the sea would disarrange
most effectually. But those female Finns, whom
the amorous Shetlanders captured before they could regain
their skin-canoes are described as "engaged in dressing their
flowing locks" at the eventful moment: a most natural proceeding
on the part of any woman who has just landed
from a sea-voyage (whether these particular women had come
all the way from Bergen, or which is likely&mdash;from some outlying
island of the Northern groups). The <i>reality</i> of those
merwomen of Shetland is manifest throughout the tales relating
to them. They bear children to their Shetland lovers;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
they "were said to make good housewives;" and their
descendants in the Shetland Islands to-day are, presumably,
as "real" and human as any of Her Majesty's subjects.
That most of those unwillingly-wedded Finn-women tried
to regain their liberty at the first opportunity is seen
from the repeated statement that the Shetland husband
was always careful to hide the "sea-skin" of his Finn
wife. But, in many cases the Finn-woman appears to
have decided to throw in her lot with her Shetland husband
and people.</p>

<p>Although Bergen was latterly the home of those Finns
who came to Shetland, it is most probable that many of the
stories regarding them related to a time when they still retained
possession of certain districts in the Shetland islands.
When they were "frequently" seen off the Orkney coast, quietly
fishing, it is most improbable that their homes were among
the Fiords of Norway&mdash;more than two hundred miles away.
It seems clear that they retained their hold upon Shetland
longer than Orkney; but even in some parts of the latter
archipelago they were apparently pretty much at home in
the year 1700. This was the date of the Rev. Mr. Brand's
tour, and a remark of his leads one to such a conclusion.
It must be remembered that those Finns were regarded as
wizards and witches by the more ignorant classes: "the
belief that witches and wizards came from the coast of
Norway disguised as seals was entertained by many of the
Shetland peasantry even so late as the beginning of the
present century." And they were regarded as, in some
sense, supernatural beings. Now Dr. Blind, in suggesting
that the "skins" of the Finns may have been (as in
one aspect they actually were) their outward garments,
"made of seal-skins, and then covered with metal rings or
scales"&mdash;in assuming this, Dr. Blind is quite in agreement with
a statement made by Brand in 1700; which is to this effect,
that "supernatural" beings were, at the date of his visit,
"frequently seen in several of the Isles (the Orkneys) dancing
and making merry <i>and sometimes seen in Armour</i>." It
ought not to be forgotten that although the Finn fisherman
"fled away most swiftly," when chased by a considerable
party of his foes, yet "it is worthy of note that the supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
object of [the Finn invaders] ... was <i>plunder</i>;"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that
"they were wont to pursue boats at sea;" that "<i>silver money
was thrown to them</i> to prevent their doing any damage to
the boat;" and that "it was dangerous in the extreme <i>to
say anything against them</i>."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Whether such attacks were
made in their small skin-canoes, or whether they used larger
vessels, it is evident that they were formidable marauders;
and that, as Dr. Blind suggests, and as the Rev. Mr. Brand
records, those Finn pirates were "sometimes seen in Armour."</p>

<p>But neither the belief in Mer-men, nor the existence of
traditionary pedigrees deduced from such people, forms a
distinctive characteristic of the Shetland Islands. Just as
there are Shetlanders who trace their lineage to one or
more ancestors of Finn blood, so are there similiar family
traditions in many parts of the British Islands. "It is believed
that there are several old Welsh families who are the
descendants" of Mer-folk; and similar examples are found
"in the traditions of the O'Flaherty, O'Sullivan, and Macnamara
families."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "The inhabitants of the Isle of Man have
a number of such stories, which may be found in Waldron;"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and the tale of Macphail of Colonsay and "The Mermaid of
Corryvreckan" is not the only Hebridean illustration of
this feature. The references that are made to mermaids in
the prefatory remarks to Leyden's version of the Corryvreckan
story are quite in keeping with the Shetland traditions.
That is, there are certain attributes ascribed to those
mer-women which, on the surface, are incredible; but which
the knowledge that is given to us by Brand and Wallace
renders quite intelligible. The "train" or "tail" of the
mermaid has only to be translated "canoe" or "kayak," and
what was formerly nonsense becomes sense. For example,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the statement that "the mermaid of Corrivrekin possessed
the power of occasionally resigning her scaly train," is only
a jumbled reminiscence of the fact referred to by Dr. Wallace
who, when speaking of the mer-men, says: "His [seal-skin]
shirt has been so fastened to the Boat, that no water can
come into his Boat to do him damage, except when he
pleases to untye it, which he does ... when he comes ashore."
In the other phraseology, he "possessed the power of
occasionally resigning his scaly train."</p>

<p>In the remarks prefacing Leyden's "Mermaid" (in The
Minstrelsy) it is stated that "mermaids were sometimes
supposed to be possessed of supernatural power." The
Shetland peasantry, also, believe (or did believe) that
"<i>witches</i> ... came from the coast of Norway disguised as
seals." And "Ranulph Higden says 'that the <i>witches</i> in the
Isle of Man anciently sold winds to mariners, and delivered
them in knots, tied upon a thread, <i>exactly as the Laplanders
did</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> At one time&mdash;if not now, Lapland was regarded as a
stronghold of "magic." Butler in referring to one of the
things "in which the Lapland Magi deal" makes selection
of this practice of "selling winds" to sailors;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the "Magi"
being (in this detail) feminine. But the British Islanders
have practised many "Lapp" mysteries: and there is a
distinct "Ugrian" element among the British people; neither
of which facts are at all at variance with the traditions that
derive the descent of many modern Britons from sea-faring
tribes of "Finns" and other Mer-folk.</p>

<p>One account<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> states, with regard to the mer-woman, that
"the sailors pretend to guess what chance they had of saving
their lives in the tempests, which always followed her appearance."
Apparently, this refers more particularly to Norway.
In the Channel Islands a similar belief exists regarding the
mer-man, who is styled "the King of the <i>Auxcriniers</i>." "<i>Il
est le baladin lugubre de la tempête</i>," says M. Victor Hugo, in
describing this mer-man of the Channel.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
explanation of this belief is that, when a tempest was
threatening, those solitary rovers&mdash;knowing that their fragile
"sea-skins" could never outride a heavy storm&mdash;made hastily
for the nearest coast. Indeed, when one looks at those delicate
little vessels, wholly dependent upon the thoroughness
of the stitching that unites the various pieces of skin together,
one can only wonder at the daring of the people who ventured
in them a hundred miles and more from any land.
"Nothing but a plank between one and Eternity" is not so
dangerous as it sounds; for planks can float one when the
worst happens. But what is to be made of half-a-dozen bits
of whalebone or wood, with one thin covering of seal-skin
stretched over them? The giving of a stitch, or the smallest
fracture in the skin&mdash;and both skiff and skiff-man are under
the water.</p>

<p>To point out the various characteristics of the traditional
mer-men and mer-women, and to suggest an explanation of
each, is more than need be attempted here. But it is
enough to remark that the mere fact that marriages between
"men" and the mer-folk were possible and frequent, is quite
sufficient to prove that there was no radical difference
between the two races. When one reads of mer-women
bearing children to land-men, and "making good house-wives"
to them; or, when one learns that the mer-men
were given to "deceiving women," then one may feel pretty
certain of their humanity.</p>

<p>It has been noticed that one of their skin-boats, or kayaks,
was "kept as a Rarity" in the Museum at Edinburgh, and
that another was preserved "in the Church of Burra in
Orkney."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> There are many British traditions of such boats
in connection with such people; although the names by
which those skiffs are popularly remembered are as unreasonable
as the "scaly train" of the Finn-woman of Corryvreckan.
In Sutherland it is said that those people used to cross the
Dornoch Firth in "cockle-shells;"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> while one man records
having seen them quitting the coasts of the Isle of Man "in
empty rum puncheons," in which vessels he "saw them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
scudding away as far as the eye could reach."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It is very
likely that those traditional "witches" who went to sea in
"sieves" were also identical with those who came from the
coast of Norway "disguised as seals;" and that the <i>sieve</i>
was nothing else than the <i>kayak</i>.</p>

<p>That the Finns of Orkney and Shetland used the long,
narrow <i>kayaks</i> of the modern Esquimaux and Samoyeds is
unmistakable: and the same shape of skiff has probably been
employed by British and other European "mer-men" for an
immemorial period. But other varieties of this kind of boat
have been used. For example, the natives of those islands
and promontories which form "the Rosses" of Donegal are
described (in the years 1753 and 1754) as using seal-skin
boats; but their shape does not seem to have been identical
with that of the kayak. "Their boats" (says a visitor to the
"Rosses" at that date<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>), "called curraghs, were oval baskets,
covered with seal-skins; and in such weak and tottering
vessels they ventured so far out as was necessary to get fish
enough for their families."</p>

<p>These <i>curraghs</i>, it would seem, were nearer those still used
in Wales (and also by the Mandans of the Upper Missouri)
than the long, covered-in skiff of the Arctic tribes. Or,
perhaps, they resemble those <i>curraghs</i> now used in Ireland,
which differ chiefly from ordinary "boats" in their frames
being covered with skins in place of planks. In his Gaelic
dictionary, Armstrong states that "the <i>curach</i>, or boat of
leather and wicker," was "much in use in the Western Isles
(Hebrides), even long after the art of building boats of wood
was introduced." As he says that Islemen "fearlessly committed
themselves, in these slight pinnaces, to the mercy of
the most violent weather," it seems most likely that the
"decked" kayak is the kind of which he is speaking, and
when he gives a diminutive form of <i>curach</i> (<i>curachan</i>),
and defines it "a little skiff; a canoe," it is almost certain
that he has in view the "kayak" of the Finn-man.</p>

<p>Whichever of these two terms may be assumed to indicate
the kayak, it is scarcely conceivable that the Hebrideans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
would "fearlessly commit themselves to the mercy of the
most violent weather," in an <i>open</i> skin-boat. But this is what
the <i>kayakers</i> do. "They do not fear venturing out to sea in
these boats in the greatest storms," says Hans Egede,
referring to the Eskimos of the eighteenth century, "because
they can swim as light upon the largest waves as a bird can
fly; and when the waves come upon them with all their
fury, they only turn the side of the boat towards them to
let them pass, without the least danger of being sunk."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
Referring to the same usage of the Orkney Finnman, Brand
says that he does this, "when <i>in a storm</i> he seeth the high
surge of a wave approaching." And Wallace's annotator
has the same remark: "They [the Finnmen] have this
advantage, that <i>be the Seas never so boisterous</i>, their boats
being made of Fish Skins, are so contrived that he can never
sink, but is like a Sea-gull swimming on the top of the watter."</p>

<p>It appears impossible to ascertain a time when skin-boats
were <i>not</i> used in Europe. In speaking of the Oestrymnic
Isles and their inhabitants, Dr. Skene quotes the following
account of their vessels, as given by Rufus Festus Avienus,
a writer of the fourth century:&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
"They know not to fit with pine<br />
Their keels, nor with fir, as use is,<br />
They shape their boats; but, strange to say,<br />
They fit their vessels with united skins,<br />
And often traverse the deep in a hide."
</div>

<p>As Dr. Skene points out, these Oestrymnic Isles were identical
with the <i>Cassiterides</i>, (<i>i.e.</i>, "Tin Islands,") and, under
either name, were famous for their tin mines. But, in identifying
them with the Scilly Isles, Dr. Skene is manifestly in
error; as all evidence on this point tends to show that the
Oestrymnides, or Cassiterides, formed a group of islands
lying off the Spanish coast, which, at some period during
the Christian era, became submerged. The fourth-century
writer quoted "says that the northern promontory of Spain
was called Oestrymnis, and adds, 'Below the summit of
this promontory the Oestrymnic bay spreads out before the
inhabitants, in which the Oestrymnic Isles show themselves.'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
The testimony of Diodorus is to the same effect: "Above
the country of the Lusitanians, there are many mines of
tin in the little islands called Cassiterides from this circumstance,
lying off Iberia, in the ocean." So also Strabo,
who states that "the Cassiterides are ten in number, and
lie near each other in the ocean, towards the north from the
haven of the Artabri."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> All this is consistently borne out
by the map of Spain ("from the Latin Ptolemy, 1478")
which Mr. Elton, who calls Dr. Skene's deduction in question,
appends to his "Origins of English History."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In that map,
it will be seen that, according to Ptolemy, the Cassiterides&mdash;ten
in number&mdash;lay off the Spanish coast, north-west of
Cape Finisterre, and that that portion of the mainland was
inhabited by the Artabri. Among all these writers and
geographers, therefore, there is entire agreement; and none
of their statements have any reference to the neighbourhood
of the English coast.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> That these islanders did not know
the art of building vessels of wood, and were accustomed
to cross the sea in skin-boats, is regarded by Dr. Skene as
corroborative of his belief that they were British and
not Iberian islanders. "But the Iberian coracles were as
well known as those of the Britons," says Mr. Elton;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and
of this we ought perhaps to see a survival in the "<i>curo</i>, a
small boat used on the Garonne," which Armstrong compares
with the Gaelic <i>curach</i>.</p>

<p>Of the presence of the skin-boat in British waters there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
is ample evidence, and it would be superfluous to enlarge
upon this. There is, moreover, evidence that certain "trans-marine
nations" came <i>to</i> Britain in such craft, in early times.
And, half-way between the opening centuries of the Christian
era and the period of the Orkney Finnmen, there is a
reference which suggests the skin-boat among the Finns of
Norway, although it does nothing more than suggest. In
the <i>Heimskringla</i> (Saga xiv) it is stated that Sigurd Slembe
and his followers passed the winter of 1139 in a cave at
Tialdasund, the sound which separates the Lofoten Isles
from the Norwegian mainland, and that on that occasion
the Finns (or Lapps, as they are indifferently called) constructed
two large boats for them. These boats were of
fir, but the peculiarity about them was that not a nail was
used in their construction. Like the framework of the
modern kayak, the various parts of these boats were fastened
together by <i>sinews</i>,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> a method which, as the saga shows, was
certainly not that of Sigurd and his people, who remark
upon the absence of nails. Thus, although this incident
shows that those Finns of the twelfth century were able to
build boats of wood, yet their method of joining the timbers
suggests the affinity which they otherwise bear to the
Eskimos. But, while their own boats may have differed
from those they built for their visitors, there is nothing in
the passage to support this assumption.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>That the round <i>curach</i> or <i>coracle</i>, covered with skin, and
similar to that still seen in Wales, was in use in the north of
Scotland in the early part of the last century, is testified to
by a letter quoted in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
<i>Proceedings of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland</i>, 1880-81, p. 179-80, from which it
will be seen that the tradition already referred to&mdash;that the
dwellers on the shores of the Dornoch Firth used to employ
"cockle-shells" as ferry-boats&mdash;is nothing but a fanciful and
imperfect resemblance of this particular kind of <i>curach</i>. The
<i>curachs</i>, however, in which the Western Islanders "fearlessly
committed themselves ... to the mercy of the most
violent weather" cannot have been of this shape. But either
variety of skin-boat was undoubtedly the property of the
one race of people. Among the Eskimos, also, there is
considerable variety. We are told, for example, in a
description of the Aleutian Islanders during last century,
that "their vessels consist of two sorts," of which one is
the <i>kayak</i>, propelled by the double-bladed paddle, while the
other is large enough to hold thirty or forty people, and
has "oars on both sides." But both kinds are skin-covered.
The Eskimo tribes have also the smaller open skin-boat,
capable of holding eight or ten people. And this, like the
similar skin-boat of the British Isles, has sometimes sails.
These facts are therefore quite consistent with the belief
that the European tribes using this variety of Eskimo boat
used also the slender, decked canoe or "kayak."</p>

<p>Enough, then, has been said to indicate the presence of
those skiff-people in various parts of the British Islands, and
in various parts of Europe. It may be that the latest
<i>authentic</i> records of British Esquimaux are those given by
Brand and Wallace, in the end of the seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
True, the Shetlandic (and perhaps other) traditions bring us
down to later dates. But traditions are necessarily uncertain.
However, we do know that the waters surrounding
the Orcadian and Shetland groups were fished in by Esquimaux
tribes so recently as the year 1700<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>; and we also know
from tradition, that these same "Finns" or "Finn-men"
"were wont to pursue boats at sea," and to demand a money-tribute
from the fishermen whom they chased. (In turn,
they themselves were pursued by the islanders, when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
made their appearance singly, near their coasts.) That they
were feared by the islanders is evident from the Shetlandic
legends; and it will be noticed that those Shetlanders who
are understood to have Finn blood in their veins "look upon
themselves as superior to common people." All this suggests
that those straggling "Finn-men" of the year 1700
were really the representatives of a decayed caste of conquerors.
The fact that they are remembered as wearing
armour places them before us as a distinctly military race;
and "the Darts they make use of for killing Fish" were
probably the least important of their weapons.</p>

<p>The non-Finnish Shetlanders who overheard the captive
woman talking with her friends "could not understand a
single word of the conversation." It is not necessary to
assume that this denoted more than a mere dialectic difference;
accent being a wonderfully important consideration in
cases of this sort. That Finn settlements were often conterminous
with districts occupied by those who regarded the
Finns as enemies is suggested by the existence of a "Finns'
Town" in Orkney, and a "Finn Town" in Donegal.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Of course, those Finns must have one or many historical
names. It is probable that they constituted a large proportion
of the population of the Outer Hebrides. One of
the stories relating to such people is of a mer-woman who
"fell in love with a young shepherd, who kept his flocks
beside a creek <i>much frequented by these marine people</i>"&mdash;the
locality being somewhere on the Manx coast. "She frequently
caressed him" (the account continues&mdash;somewhat
superfluously), "and brought him presents of coral, fine
pearls, and every valuable production of the ocean."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Now,
this woman may easily have been one of those "marine
people" who inhabited various parts of the Hebrides, and
who used the skin-skiff of the Esquimaux "even long after
the art of building boats of wood was introduced." The
coral and "fine pearls" which this mer-woman brought to
her Manx lover may have come from no greater distance
than the Island of Skye: since Martin tells us that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
people of that island used to adorn their garments with
"fine stones" and "pieces of red coral"&mdash;the latter article
being found in "great quantity" on the shores of the Lewis.
At that time the islanders of Jura dwelt in turf-covered
wigwams identical with those used by modern Lapps; as
may be seen from the illustration here copied from Pennant's
second "Tour." And the people of Harris were
described in the following terms, in the early part of this
century<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>:&mdash;"In general the natives are of small stature,...
Scarcely any attain the height of 6 feet, and many of
the males are not higher than 5 feet 3 or 4 inches." "The
Harrisian physiognomy" is thus detailed: "The cheek bones
are rather prominent, and the nose is invariably short, the
space between it and the chin being disproportionately long.
The complexion is of all tints. Many individuals are as
dark as mulattoes...." The population thus described
was greatly mingled at the period when these latter observations
were made; but there is nevertheless strong
evidence of the possession of Ugrian blood in the people
thus portrayed. And their boats and dwellings do nothing
to contradict this theoretical connection with the races we
now know by such names as Lapp, Finn, Samoyed, and
Eskimo.</p>

<p>The author of the "Gallovidian Encyclopædia" gives also
a hint of the existence of such a population in Galloway:
when (under the name "cutty glies") he refers to "a class
of females," whom he describes as "little" and "squat-made,"
and to whom he assigns (without exception) the
amorous nature of the Manx mer-woman just spoken of.
And, as the Gallovidian chronicler lived near the inlet known
as "the Manxman's Lake," it is not improbable that this also
was "a creek much frequented by these marine people";
and that, in short, Mactaggart's "little, squat-made females"
were of the same stock as the Mer-women of the Isle of
Man and the Hebrides, and the Finn-women of the Northern
Isles.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>It is clear that those popular traditions and records, as
well as the indisputable statements of Brand and Wallace,
indicate two very different kinds of people, who, sometimes
fighting, sometimes inter-marrying, occupied territories that
were, in many cases, conterminous. That they were often
enemies is evident. The Finn-man, when alone, was hunted
from the non-Finnish islands by the natives: and, on the
other hand, he was "wont to pursue boats at sea," and to
demand tribute from the fishermen&mdash;when his superior arms,
or the number of his comrades, warranted him to do so.</p>

<p>Now, there is documentary evidence of this state of things
during the seventeenth century; though the localities therein
referred to are the Northern Hebrides, rather than the Orkney
and Shetland Isles. But the description corresponds, in
everything else, with that given by the Islesmen of the North-East.
We are told<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> that, in the year 1635, certain sections
of the Hebridean Islanders "comes in troupes and companeis
out of the Yles where they dwell to the Yles and
Loches where the fishes ar tane and there violentlie spoyles
his Majesteis subjects of their fisches and sometimes of their
victualls and other furniture and persewes thame of their
lyffes, breakes the schooles of thair herring and comitts
manie moe insolenceis upoun thame to the great hinder
and disappointing of the fishing, hurt of his Majesteis subjects,
to the contempt of his Majesteis auctoritte and lawes,"
etc. This&mdash;even to the detail that they "by their coming
drive away the Fishes from the Coasts"&mdash;is an exactly
similar account to that given, in the same century, to Brand
and Wallace, and in the present century (but relating to
about the same period) to Dr. Karl Blind. In the one case,
the scene is the North-Western coasts of Scotland: in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
other it is the North-Eastern. But the kind of people
described are pretty evidently alike.</p>

<p>In either case, too, the Mer-folk or Finn-men are not
spoken of as subjects of the Modern-British kingdom. The
Proclamation of 1635, quoted above, does not regard "some
of the inhabitants of the Yles of this kingdome," as being
"his Majesteis subjects." The phrase, "Yles <i>of this kingdome</i>"
does, indeed, imply something of a common nationality;
but, as a matter of fact, certain portions of North-Western
Scotland were not strictly under the rule of Charles
the First, at that period. That this was so may be seen (if
nowhere else) in the papers relating to those territories, of
dates ranging from 1574 to 1635, which are quoted in the
<i>Collectanea de Rebus Albanicis</i> (pp. 100-121). One of these
is a letter written by Charles I. "to the Privy Council of
Scotland directing an inquiry into the exactions by the
Heritors of the [Hebridean] Isles from those engaged in the
Fisheries; and the bringing in of Foreigners by the Heritors."
And this letter runs as follows: "Whereas it is not unknown
to you with what care we have intendit the good of the
Association of the Fischings within thess our Kingdomes
<i>for the use of our subjects</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and that we will be provident to
protect <i>them</i> from the exaction of the <i>heritours in the Yles</i>,
who as we are informed without warrant exact sundrie
dewteis from them to their great prejudice, bringing in
strangers and loading the vessells with fisches and other native
commoditeis contrair to our lawis," etc. The letter then commands
the Scotch Privy Council to learn "upon what warrant
they ["the landislordis of the Yles wher the fisching is"] tak
thess dewteis." In the Report made, six months later, by
the Commissioners appointed by the Privy Council, regarding
"the duteis exacted be the Ylanders frome his Majesteis

stated: "<i>that it was the ancient custome</i>[2] ... to everie ane

<p>Through all these documents of this period there runs a
feeling (not distinctly formulated) that "his Majesteis subjects"&mdash;"his
Majesteis frie liegis"&mdash;"the haill inhabitantis of
The Burrowis of this Realme"&mdash;were terms that did not
strictly apply to "the heritours in the Yles." And that these
latter&mdash;though nominally the subjects of the British monarch&mdash;still
exercised a kind of semi-sovereignty in their own
territories; enforcing tribute from "his Majesty's free lieges,"
and carrying on commercial relations with "foreigners," contrary
to the wishes of Charles himself. That these independent
rights were to some extent recognized by Charles
may be gathered from his own expressions in the documents
referred to. And the existence of this antagonism to
British law was quite distinctly acknowledged by Charles'
father (James) when, in the year 1608, he issued his instructions
to a Commission "appointed for the Improvement of
the Isles;" wherein he states his "desire to remove all suche
scandalous reproches aganis that state, in suffering a pairt
of it to be possessed with suche wild savageis voide of Godis
feare and our obedience."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Nor was this independence confined to the mere exacting
of a tribute, according to "ancient custom," from those fishermen
who, themselves coming under the denomination of "his
Majesty's subjects," resorted occasionally to the coasts of the
North-Western Isles. The Report of 1634 showed that this
tax was rigorously levied by those Island kings when the
alien fishermen arrived within the "bounds" of certain
islands. But they did not content themselves with this. The
Proclamation of the Scotch Privy Council of the following
year (1635) begins by stating that "the Lords of Privy
Council ar informed that of lait ther hes been manie great
insolenceis committit be some of the inhabitants of the Yles
of this kingdome not onlie upoun his Majesteis subjects
hanting the trade of fisching in the Yles but upon the Lords
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and others of the Association<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of the Royall Fishing of
Great Britane and Ireland; whiche Ylanders comes in
troupes and companeis <i>out of the Yles where they dwell</i> to
the Yles and Loches where the fishes ar tane and there
violentlie spoyles his Majesteis subjects of their fisches and
sometimes of their victualls and other furniture and persewes
thame of their lyffes," etc. This statement reveals quite
plainly a condition of enmity between "his Majesty's subjects,"
and certain sections of the Hebridean population.
And the traveller, Pennant, furnishes additional proof of this
state of things, in describing the condition of society in the
Island of Skye (or its vicinity) at about the period under consideration.
"Each chieftain (he tells us&mdash;and the "chieftains"
of whom he speaks were presumably "his Majesty's
subjects")&mdash;each chieftain had his armour-bearer, who preceded
his master in time of war, and, by my author's account
in time of peace; for they went armed even to church, in
the manner the North-Americans [the colonists] do at
present in the frontier settlement, and for the same reason,
<i>the dread of savages</i>." Of which "savages" there are many
traditions still extant in the legendary lore of the West
Highlands.</p>

<p>Of more historical nature is the evidence of Buchanan,
who, in describing the Inner Hebrides, during the seventeenth
century, states that the island of Pabbay, close to
the Skye coast, was then "infamous for robberies, where the
thieves, from their lurking-places in the woods, with which it
is covered, intercept the unwary travellers." Of the island
of Rona, lying a little to the northward of Pabbay, and, at
that time, "covered with wood and heath," he says: "In a
deep bay it has a harbour, dangerous for voyagers, as it
affords a covert for pirates, whence to surprise the passengers."
To the west of Skye, and in the Outer Hebrides,
there was the island of Uist, containing "numerous caves
covered with heath, the lurking-places of robbers." Off
the mainland coast to the north-east of Skye, lay "the island
Eu, almost wholly covered with wood, and of service only
to the robbers, who lurk there to surprise travellers;" while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
"more to the north lies Gruinort (says the same writer), also
darkened with wood, and infested with robbers." That is to
say, all of these districts <i>belonged</i> to certain races who waged
war against other populations in that archipelago; and who,
in all probability, were the "savages" referred to by the
traveller Pennant.</p>

<p>It is not only this latter writer and James VI. of Scotland
who refer to certain North British populations in the seventeenth
century as "savages." Nor are such people only
visible in the Hebrides at that date. "In a curious old book
called 'Northern Memoirs; calculated for the Meridian of
Scotland,' written in the year 1658,"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> the following short
description occurs with reference to the district of Strath
Navar, in the north of the county of Sutherland:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The next curiosity to entertain you with, is the county of Southerland,
which we enter by crossing a small arm of the ocean from Tain
to Dornoch. So from thence we travel into Cathness and the county
of Stranavar, where a rude sort of inhabitants dwell (almost as barbarous
as Cannibals), who, when they kill a beast, boil him in his
hide, make a caldron of his skin, browis of his bowels, drink of his
blood, and bread and meat of his carcase. Since few or none
amongst them hitherto have as yet understood any better rules or
methods of eating."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, then, is a community of people, "almost as barbarous
as Cannibals," in the estimation of a civilized writer of 1658.
But none of the expressions of this kind, used by writers
of the seventeenth century, will strike modern men more
strongly than that applied to the Finn-men of Orkney in
the Minute Book of the Edinburgh College of Physicians.
To the civilized Scotch of two centuries ago those Finn-men
were simply savages,&mdash;"barbarous men." The term "savage"
is always a relative one; and what one civilization regards
as savagery is really the fag-end of an earlier civilization.
Nevertheless, the seventeenth-century Finn-man represented
what must necessarily appear to us as a "savage" state of
society, if that word is to have any meaning at all. And
the predominant castes of Orkney and Shetland and the
mainland of Scotland were quite in unison upon this point.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
The Edinburgh physicians, as a matter of course, regarded
those kayakers as "barbarous men," just as we regard their
Arctic kindred to-day. The same view was taken by the
predominant castes in the Inner Hebrides, at the same
period, and apparently with regard to the same race of people.
At that period, therefore, the seventeenth century, we see
the higher castes of Scotland asserting themselves against
an "Eskimo" race that threatened the safety of the more
civilized populations all along the northern and western
fringe of the country.</p>

<p>Even last century, something that modern nomenclature
calls "savage" was visible in these north-western localities.
On one occasion, when Dr. Johnson and his irrepressible
biographer were exploring those north-western islands, the
natives who rowed their boat seemed, to Boswell, "so like
wild Indians that a very little imagination was necessary to
give one an impression of being upon an American river."
One of them, he tells us, was "a robust, black-haired fellow,
half-naked, and bare-headed, something between a wild
Indian and an English tar" (of the eighteenth century).
And some of the McRaas of the mainland he describes as
being "as black and wild in their appearance as any American
savages whatever."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Other tokens of "savage" customs might easily be adduced.
For example, decaying specimens of the rude "dug-out," the
most primitive of all canoes&mdash;a mere hollowed log&mdash;are now
and then found in the depths of some Highland loch, or peat-bog;
and are rashly pronounced to be "pre-historic;"
whereas these very canoes were in common use in the north
and west of Scotland less than two centuries ago.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> However,
neither this species of canoe, nor the vague references of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Boswell, point unmistakably to the Ugrian or Mongoloid
castes whom we are here considering; although it is not
unlikely that these latter were one and the same as the
"wild Indians" and the owners of the "dug-outs."</p>

<p>What is certain is that, when, in the October of 1599, one
of the ships belonging to the Fifeshire colonists of the Lewis
was about to start on its homeward trip, it was surrounded by
"a fleet of small vessels peculiar to those islands," and the
natives, swarming on board, put to death all except the captain.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Now (although the act was simply a legitimate incident
in the warfare of the time and locality), these islanders
were the people whom King James spoke of as "wild
savages." And it is tolerably certain that their "small
vessels" were those "slight pinnaces" of skin that Armstrong
says were "much in use in the Western Isles"&mdash;in
other words, the <i>kayaks</i> of the Eskimos or Finn-men. It is
not unlikely that the resemblance to the modern Eskimo was
very close in many details. For example, the West Highland
traditions tell of "savages" who played the game of
chess; which fact in itself argues decidedly a form of civilization.
Now, although the art of carving chessmen is extinct
among modern Hebrideans, the traditional accounts were
quite borne out by the discovery, in this century, of the now
famous Lewis chessmen, "in all fifty-eight pieces, ingeniously
and elaborately carved from the walrus tooth."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Consequently,
it would appear that the Finn-man occasionally
hunted the walrus, in which pursuit he no doubt
employed "the Dart he makes use of for killing Fish:"
exactly like a modern Eskimo.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>But, admitting the existence, at so recent a date, of a
visibly "Eskimo" caste in some parts of the Hebrides, what
evidence is there that any of these people found their way to
Shetland? One writer, we have seen, brings the Shetland
Finns all the way from Davis Straits, another draws them
from Finland, and the Shetlanders themselves say that they
"came ow'r fa Norraway," especially from the neighbourhood
of Bergen. The correctness of this last belief need not be
questioned, as regards some of that caste. But it has been
suggested in the foregoing pages that many of those "Finns"
who persecuted the Shetland fishermen were those kayak-using
Hebrideans who avowed their ancient right to despoil
and to exact tribute from others, not only when fishing
among "the Isles where they dwell," but in other waters.</p>

<p>We read<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> of raids made in the Orkneys and Shetland,
during the latter part of the fifteenth century, by "bands of
Islemen" (<i>i.e.</i>, Hebrideans), "Irish, and Scots, from the
woods"; which last term strongly suggests the "robber"
denizens of the thickly-wooded islands spoken of by
Buchanan two centuries later. The raiders were, no doubt,
heterogeneous. But the piratical kayak-men were surely
among them. There are many traditions extant in some
parts of the north-eastern archipelagos regarding these raids&mdash;in
the island of Westray, in Orkney, for instance, where,
at a certain "Fitty Hill," there was once a great fight between
the Westray people and the invading Lewismen, all
of whom were slain. Now, this Fitty Hill is associated
strongly with the people recognizable as "Finns," or at least
was so in the year 1701, according to a writer previously
quoted (Brand, p. 57), and both he and Wallace (who wrote
in 1688) mention the frequent visits of Finn-men to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Westray fishing-grounds. Indeed, the <i>kayak</i> preserved in
Edinburgh seems, according to the latter writer, to have
been one of those secured by the Orkneymen; who probably
made sure that the Finn himself should have no further use
for it.</p>

<p>Thus, it is a simple historical fact that certain castes of the
Hebrideans, whose practice of despoiling and exacting
tribute from others was a thing beyond question, were very
frequent visitors to the Orkney and Shetland groups, whose
natives they did their utmost to overawe. And, as the skin
skiffs of the Hebrideans were of such a description that the
skiffmen "fearlessly committed themselves in these slight
pinnaces to the mercy of the most violent weather," they
were well qualified to sing the song of the Finn-man:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
I am a man upo' da land,<br />
I am a selkie i da sea.<br />
</div>

<p>Indeed, the concluding lines of that verse are peculiarly
appropriate to the Hebridean. For the "shöol skerry," which
is the rocky islet of <i>Sule</i> or <i>Sula</i>, lying about forty miles
N.N.E. of Cape Wrath, formed a very convenient refuge for
him when "far from every strand," during his voyages between
Shetland or Orkney and the Hebrides.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>And it is in this aspect, as tyrannical sea-rovers, that the
"Finns" are often remembered in Shetlandic tradition. It
was their custom to pursue the boats of the Shetland fishermen,
and to exact from them a tribute in "silver money."
So much were they dreaded that "it was dangerous in the
extreme to say anything against them." The original feeling
of respect must have been very strong, since it has survived
into the present century.</p>

<p>This, of course, relates to the Finns considered as men and
as fighters. The other side of the question shows us the
Finn-women, and also the Finn-men in peaceful guise. And
here, too, it is evident that those people were by no means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
regarded as an <i>inferior</i> race by the non-Finnish section of
the Shetlanders (whatever that non-Finnish element may
have been composed of), for those who claim a "Finn
descent" at the present day regard this line of their ancestry
as wholly superior to that which, for want of a better word,
may be called "Shetlandic."</p>

<p>The Finn-women, we are told, very frequently became the
wives of the islanders: and, consequently, they became the
mothers of "half-breed" families&mdash;that is, in those cases
where the husband himself was of a wholly different stock.
In some instances, owing to a Finn connection in the previous
generation, such children may have been more Finnish than
anything else. Many of the Finn wives seem to have cast in
their lot altogether with their Shetland husbands, to whom
they brought dowries of cattle which&mdash;according to the
peasant tradition&mdash;they "conjured up from the deep," of
which the probable interpretation is that they caused them to
be sent across from Bergen. Peaceful memories of the Finn-men
may also be traced in such things as the rhyme of the
medicine-man who "came ow'r fa Norraway" to conjure the
toothache out of some unhappy Shetlander.</p>

<p>But these references, and apparently all the more recent
of the Shetlandic traditions, point to Norway, and not to the
Hebrides, as the home of the Finns; and it seems quite clear
that the Bergen neighbourhood was a stronghold of this
Mongoloid people within recent times.</p>

<p>Mr. H. Howorth,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> in discussing these Mongoloid, or Ugrian
people, remarks: "The Finns and Laps have been pushed
back in Scandinavia to a very small portion of their ancient
holding. In Livonia, in Esthonia, and in three-fourths of
European Russia the Ugrians were, even in the eleventh
century, the preponderating population"; that is, Esthonia
and Livonia then formed a part of "Finland," and the Gulf
of Riga was a Finnish sea. We are not given a date as
to their "preponderance" in Scandinavia; but, if they were
so numerous in the east Baltic districts during the eleventh
century, it may be assumed that they were also of considerable
importance in the Scandinavian peninsula at the same
time, and even much later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>There is, at any rate, a very interesting reference to Finns
of Swedish nationality, made in connection with these Finns
of Orkney. A last-century reader of Wallace's "Description
of Orkney" (whose occasional comments upon that book
are included in the reprint of 1883) gives, as his opinion,
that the "Finnmen" of Orkney, in the years 1682-4, belonged
to "the Finns, or inhabitants of Finland, part of the
kingdom of Sweden." Whether this writer meant the Finns
of Esthonia and Livonia, or of Finland proper&mdash;for all
these provinces were under Swedish rule in the seventeenth
century&mdash;it is evident that he went too far afield for his
"Finnmen." But what really is important is the statement
which he goes on to make, incidentally, with regard to the
Finns of Sweden. "They had," he says, "a settlement in
Pennsylvania, near the freshes of the river Delaware, in the
neighbourhood of the Dutch, who were the first planters
here" (and he gives as his authority "The British Empire
in America," vol. i. p. 309).</p>

<p>Now, this colony of Swedish <i>Finns</i> is clearly that which is
otherwise spoken of as a colony of <i>Swedes</i>. When William
Penn took possession, in the year 1682, of the territory which
has ever since been associated with his memory, those
"Swedes" were already settled there. "'He was hailed
there with acclamation by the Swedes and Dutch,' says one
authority, who informs us that the Swedes were living in log
cabins and clay huts. The men dressed in 'leather breeches,
jerkins, and match coats,' the women in 'skin jackets and
linsey petticoats.'"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Those <i>Swedes</i>, then, of 1682, are
identified by an eighteenth-century writer with the Swedish
<i>Finns</i> of that period, and at the same time with the contemporary
Finns of Orkney: who, also, according to Brand,
wore "coats of leather." And their "log cabins and clay
huts" were probably very much like the sod-covered dwellings
of modern Lapps.</p>

<p>It is an interesting picture. Because this is plainly an
infusion of unadulterated "Eskimo" blood, among the Pennsylvanians
of that date, which is quite independent of the
representatives of that family at present occupying Greenland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and the northern parts of British North America. It is
"Eskimo" blood that was "European" only two or three
centuries ago. And it is quite likely that many modern
Americans whose descent is drawn from those seventeenth-century
colonists of Pennsylvania, referred to as "Swedes,"
have some of this blood in their veins. That they may have
inherited a further share of it through other channels&mdash;"British,"
and perhaps also "Dutch"&mdash;is quite probable.</p>

<p>There is something very suggestive in the Shetland accounts
that, several generations ago, Shetland fishermen were
frequently terrorized into paying "silver money" as tribute
to people who are said to have come across from Bergen.
Many portions of the north-eastern corner of Scotland
appear to have been within the diocese of Bergen, and to
have owned the authority of that province up to very modern
times. Of this there is ample evidence in title-deeds and
other documents. This, of course, was a survival of the
Scandinavian suzerainty over the extreme north and west
of Scotland, which in the fifteenth century was actual
sovereignty, as regards Orkney and Shetland; while, for the
Hebrides, the Scottish monarchs had to pay a yearly tribute
known as "The Annual of Norway." And at an earlier
period still, the Sudereys, or South Hebrides, and the Isle of
Man, were included in this tributary kingdom. It is certainly
worth considering whether the withdrawal of the legendary
"marine people" from the Isle of Man, and their gradual
disappearance (as "marine people") from the whole western
and northern extremities of Scotland, which seems to coincide
very closely, in time, with the decay of Scandinavian
authority in these localities, ought not to be regarded as
signifying that that authority was rooted in Mongoloid
supremacy.</p>

<p>However, our present purpose is not to guess at the name
or names by which these people must be known to history,
but to emphasize their existence as a Mongoloid race. That
the present British people show traces of such a line of
ancestry is the opinion of many modern ethnologists. In
his "Origins of English History" Mr. Elton recognizes a
type "not unlike the modern Eskimo," as existent in certain
parts of England. Mr. J. F. Campbell, in his "Popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Tales of the West Highlands," contends strongly for the past
existence in that locality of a race akin to modern Lapps.
And the Iberian theorists discern a similar type in "the
small, swarthy Welshman," "the small, dark Highlander,"
and the "Black Celts to the west of the Shannon." The
question of complexion is, of course, but of minor importance,
since it is anatomical structure that determines
affinity. The modern Eskimo races themselves show this,
for they include all shades, from dark or olive to actual
red and white; although plainly of one general stock.</p>

<p>They exhibited an American-Eskimo chief, "as a Rarity,"
at some of the eastern seaports of Scotland, a few years
ago. But it is probable that a considerable number of the
spectators were looking at a man who almost exactly resembled
one or more of their own ancestors, not many
generations back; not only in the style of his dress and in
his general appearance, as he shot his slender kayak across
their waters, but also, to a very great extent, in his physical
features. And it is much the same with many millions of
Europeans (and their offshoots), who, chiefly through intermixture,
and partly on account of altered conditions of life,
are no longer recognizable, to a superficial observer, as in
any degree connected with this "Eskimo" stock.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>When the twelfth-century Norseman, Sigurd Slembe, with
his twenty followers, spent a whole winter with the Lapps or
Finns, as stated in the "Heimskringla" (Saga <span class="smcap">XIV</span>), it is evident
that the two sets of men were in intimate association. Their
life at that time is thus described in Sigurd's song:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"In the Lapland tent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brave days we spent,</span><br />
Under the grey birch tree;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In bed or on bank</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We knew no rank,</span><br />
And a merry crew were we.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Good ale went round</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As we sat on the ground,</span><br />
Under the grey birch tree;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And up with the smoke</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flew laugh and joke,</span><br />
And a merry crew were we."<br />
</div>

<p>It was at that time, also, that the Lapps made for Sigurd
those "sinew-fastened boats," in which he and his party
voyaged southward in spring. In these accounts there is no
mention made of the Lapp or Finn women, but their presence
there must certainly be taken for granted. And there
is no reason for supposing that they were less friendly to
their guests than the Finn men were. There are evidences,
indeed, that the Ugrians and the non-Ugrians of Scandinavia,
of either sex, were on a friendly footing two centuries before
Sigurd Slembe's day. When Eric, the son of Harald Haarfager,
was in Lapland on one occasion, he there found his
future wife, Gunhild, living in a hut with "two of the most
knowing Laplanders in all Finmark." She had come there,
she said, "to learn Lapland-art," in which these two Lapps
were deeply versed. The way in which she entrapped her
hosts, and went off with Eric, is described in the Saga (Harald
Haarfager's, chap. xxxiv), and it argues something for Eric's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
magnanimity or indifference that he chose this lady to be
his bride. However, the point is that in Gunhild we have a
presumably non-Ugrian woman, living in the most friendly
way with a couple of Lapp "magicians."</p>

<p>Again, we find Harald Haarfager himself actually marrying
a Finn woman. We are told (chap. xxv of his <i>Saga</i>)
how, one winter, when Harald was moving about Upland "in
guest-quarters," he was induced by "the Fin Svase," who
announced himself to the king's followers as "the Fin<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> whose
hut the King had promised to visit," to not only fulfil the
said promise, but then and there to marry Snaefrid, the
daughter of the Finn. Whether he took this step by reason
of the beauty of the Finn girl, or of the strength of the
mead which she poured out to him, or of the "magic" which
she and her father exercised upon him, is a matter of little
moment. The fact remains that she became his queen, and
in course of time bore to him four sons: Sigurd Hrise, Halfdan
Haleg, Gudrod Liome, and Rognvald Rettilbeine: who,
consequently, were half-bred Finns&mdash;that is, assuming that
Harald himself was of pure non-Ugrian blood.</p>

<p>These four sons of Harald's Finn wife are subsequently to
be met with in this Saga; which tells how "they grew up to
be very clever men, very expert in all exercises." When
Harald was fifty years of age, he gave to three of them, as
to his other sons, "the kingly title and dignity," assigning
to them, as their portion of his kingdom, the territories of
"Ringerike, Hadeland, Thoten, and the lands thereto belonging."
But one of the four, Halfdan, did not live to
attain this dignity. Several years before, he, like Harald's
many other sons, had resented his exclusion from place
and dignity, and the advancement of mere "earls" instead;
"for they [Harald's sons] thought earls were of inferior
birth to them." Consequently, Halfdan and his brother
Gudrod "set off one spring with a great force, and came
suddenly upon Earl Rognvald, Earl of Möre, and surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the house in which he was, and burnt him and sixty men
in it." Then, leaving his brother in temporary possession
of that earldom, "Halfdan took three long-ships, and fitted
them out, and sailed into the West Sea." The Earl of
Orkney at that time was Einar ("Turf" Einar), and on
Halfdan's unexpected appearance he fled. For six months
the Finn woman's son ruled over Orkney. But in the
autumn, Einar returned, and "after a short battle," totally
defeated and put to flight Halfdan and his followers.
"Einar and his men lay all night without tents, and when
it was light in the morning they searched the whole island,
and killed every man they could lay hold of. Then Einar
said: 'What is that I see upon the Isle of Ronaldsha?<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
Is it a man or a bird? Sometimes it raises itself up, and
sometimes lies down again.' They went to it, and found
it was Halfdan Haaleg, and took him prisoner." Einar
thereupon killed Halfdan, and he and his men raised a
mound of stones and gravel over the corpse; which mound,
if not yet opened, will no doubt disclose to some modern
craniologist the exact ethnological status of this semi-Finn.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>With regard to another brother of Halfdan's, Rognvald
Rettilbeine, it is stated that he ruled over Hadeland, and
became famous for his skill in witchcraft, in which he was no
doubt instructed by his Lapp relatives. This, indeed, was
the cause of his death. For, at the instigation of their
common father, his half-brother Eric (Bloody-axe) "burned
his brother Rognvald in a house along with eighty other warlocks,"
on account of these same alleged malpractices.</p>

<p>These are only a few recorded instances, which reveal the
Finns and the non-Finns as sometimes closely allied not only
by association, but by blood. But from them it may be
inferred that many other intermarriages between the two
races took place, and that the Finns, although eventually conquered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
as a distinct people, were frequently men of rank and
importance among the Scandinavians of eight or nine centuries
ago. As an instance of a Finn occupying an official
position (certainly much inferior to that of the semi-Finnish
kings of Ringerike, Hadeland, and Thoten), we have the
"Finn Sauda-Ulfsson," who appears as "engaged in drawing
in King Inge's rents and duties" at Viken, Norway, in the
twelfth century ("Heimskringla," Saga XIV, chap. vii). And a
certain notable Ketill flat-nose,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> or Ketill Finn, whose memory
is doubtless embalmed in Ketill's-sæter (now Kettlester), in
the island of Yell, Shetland, was clearly of Finn blood.
When he, and such as he&mdash;the semi-Ugrian sons of Harald,
for example&mdash;held sway in Shetland and Orkney, and when
men and women of either race occasionally, perhaps frequently,
lived together, a state of things existed that closely
resembled that described in Mr. Karl Blind's Shetlandic
traditions&mdash;when "Finns came ow'r fa Norraway" and practised
magic and witchcraft, and domineered over the people
of the northern islands.</p>

<p>Of course, it is impossible to say what proportion the Finn
blood bore to the other. Yet it is quite evident that the
Finns, while often at war with the race that overcame them,
were also frequently their allies, and that the two peoples
became to some extent blended in blood. Consequently,
when one discovers among modern British people physical
traces of a race "not unlike the modern Eskimo," in localities
famed as the scene of many a Scandinavian raid, these
traces may reasonably be attributed to those very inroads.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>The references made in the two preceding chapters bear
specially upon those Finns who "came ow'r fa Norraway"
to the islands of Shetland and Orkney. But if the assumption
be correct that many of the Finns who landed in Shetland
and fished in Shetlandic waters came thither direct
from the Hebrides, it is to be presumed that Gaelic as well
as English tradition has something to say regarding them.
And as there are several words in use in Shetland which
are also in use among West Highlanders,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> it is not unlikely
that these people may be known in the West Highlands
by the same name as in Shetland.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that Highland tradition does bear testimony
to the former existence of a special race or caste of
people known by a name which resembles that of the Finns
so closely that it may reasonably be regarded as only a
variant of "Finn." In a certain charter of Alexander II. of
Scotland (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1214-49, reference is made to a well which
is known in Gaelic as <i>Tuber na Feinn</i>, <i>Feinne</i> or <i>Feyne</i>; and
an old gloss (date unknown) explains that this term signifies
"the Well of the grett or kempis men callit Fenis."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Or, in
more modern English, "The Well of the great men or champions
called <i>Feens</i>, <i>Fenns</i>, <i>Feenies</i>, or <i>Fennies</i>."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Here, then,
we have record of a certain race of "kempies" or fighters,
who were known in English as <i>Feens</i>, etc., and in Gaelic as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the <i>Feinne</i>. One does not require to know much of Gaelic
tradition&mdash;one need not know anything of it&mdash;to be well
aware of the fact that that legendary lore is fairly alive with
stories of the "Feinne," whatever may have been the ethnological
position of the caste thus named. And, just as in
modern Shetland we have people proclaiming with pride their
descent from the <i>Finns</i>, so have we West Highlanders and
Hebrideans boasting that the <i>Feinne</i> were among their forefathers.
Just as Mr. Karl Blind met with a modern Shetland
woman who asserted that she was "fifth from da Finns," so
did the late Mr. J. F. Campbell, in 1871, converse with a
Skyeman, "Donald MacDonald, styled Na Feinne"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>&mdash;that
is, "of the Feens." If the "Feinne" of Gaelic story are
really the same people as the "Finns" of Shetlandic tradition,
it will not be for lack of statements made regarding
them if we do not learn a great deal more about these people
through Gaelic channels.</p>

<p>Without either hastily accepting or condemning this hypothetical
identification, let us look a little further into the
circumstances of the Gaelic <i>Feinne</i>. And it may be as well
first to decide upon an English equivalent of this Gaelic
plural. Mr. J. F. Campbell states that the singular is <i>Fiann</i>;
but, even when writing in English, he prefers to adhere to
the Gaelic form of the plural&mdash;thus, "the Feinn" or "the
Feinne." However, both Dr. Skene and another writer (the
late Rev. J. G. Campbell, Tiree), have Englished this into
"the Fians." This approaches so closely to the marginal
"Fenis" of the old charter of Alexander II., that we may
take "the Feens" as a good enough modern English equivalent
for the Gaelic plural. (For the vowels in <i>Fians</i> and
<i>Feinne</i> receive the old or Continental pronunciation, these
words having the sound of "Feeans" and "Fane," or
"Fayny," according to modern English spelling.) In order,
therefore, to avoid the confusion that might arise from
Englishing "the Feinne" into "the Finns" (although we are
tacitly assuming, in the meantime, that the latter really
expresses the ethnological position of the former), let us
refer to "the Feinne" of Gaelic story as "the Feens."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>So lately as the latter part of the seventeenth century,
certain districts of Scotland were recognized as specially
"the land of the Feinne." Dr. Skene, on the page which
tells us of the <i>Tobar na Feinne</i>, or Well of the Feens, states
that Kirke (the Rev. Robert Kirke, minister of Balquhidder,
in Perthshire), in his Psalter, which was published in 1684,
refers to the territory stretching from Loch Linnhe north-west
to, and inclusive of, the Outer Hebrides<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> as "the generous
land of the Feinne."</p>

<p>"The land of the Feens," therefore, according to this
Scotch writer of the seventeenth century, embraced the
Outer Hebrides and a certain portion of the opposite mainland,
known in the Highlands as "the rough bounds." It is
thus evident at the outset that we do not obviously make a
false start in assuming that the <i>Feens</i> of Gaelic tradition
ought to be regarded as forming a section of the <i>Finns</i> who
visited Shetland in the seventeenth century. In 1684 Kirke
regarded the Hebrides as the land of the Feens; in 1688
Wallace records the occasional arrival of Finns or Finnmen
on the coasts of Orkney and Shetland. And we have
already seen that skin kayaks, such as those which bore the
Finn visitors to the islands of the north-east were employed
at about the same period by inhabitants of the Hebrides.
Certain sections of the Hebrideans are recorded in history
as making warlike descents upon the fisheries of Orkney
and Shetland. And these Hebrideans dwelt in "the land
of the Feens."</p>

<p>But the seventeenth century is much too recent a date for
studying the Gaelic accounts of the Feens. These accounts
go back to the period when Gaelic was peculiarly associated
with what seems to have been its earliest home in the
British Islands&mdash;Ireland. That they also relate to the more
recent period of the Irish or Gaelic settlements in Scotland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
is manifest. But they are substantially Gaelic (<i>i.e.</i>, Irish),
and they deal with events which cannot be limited to the
time of the Irish invasions of Scotland; and they relate to
localities which are not merely British, but European.</p>

<p>"Who were the <i>Feens</i> of tradition, and to what country
and period are they to be assigned?" is the question asked
by one of the most learned of the authorities from whom these
statements are obtained.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> And his answer, after due consideration,
is, that "we may fairly infer that they were of the
population who immediately preceded the Scots [Gaels] in
Erin [Ireland] and in Alban [Scotland, north of the Forth
and Clyde], and that they belong to that period in the history
of both countries before a political separation had taken
place between them, when they were viewed as parts of one
territory, though physically separated, and when a free and
unrestrained intercourse took place between them; when
race, and not territory, was the great bond of association, and
the movements of their respective populations from one
country to the other were not restrained by any feeling of
national separation."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Distinct and important as this announcement is, it requires
still further consideration. Our guide in this question has
shown us that in such modern times as the seventeenth century,
the Feens of Scotland were restricted to a small corner
of the West Highlands and to the Hebrides; which territory
was so far associated with them that an intelligent writer of
that century spoke of it as the land of the Feens. But Dr.
Skene points also to a much earlier period, when the Feens
inhabited, if they did not possess and exclusively occupy, the
whole of Ireland and Irish-Scotland. And he indicates
further that they had dwelt in these districts before the
advent of the Milesians (or Gaels). More than that, he
shows us that the lands in which they lived included a
portion of the continent of Europe.</p>

<p>In opposition to the theory manufactured by the Irish
historians, that the Feens were "a standing body of Milesian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
militia, having peculiar privileges and strange customs," Dr.
Skene holds the conviction that, "when looked at a little
more closely," they "assume the features of a distinct race."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
As a proof of this, he quotes three verses from an old poem
on the Battle of Gabhra (or <i>Gawra</i>, as the more softened
pronunciation has it). This battle of Gawra is said to have
been fought in Ireland, on the border of the counties of
Meath and Dublin, and it is placed by some in the third
century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> It appears to have been the outcome of the
resolution made by the High King of Ireland, Cormac Mac
Art, to renounce for ever the tributary position which he and
other kings occupied towards their over-lords, the Feens.
The Irish monarch is said to have aimed at the complete
extermination of the race in one district at least; to have
"Great Alvin [apparently the modern Allen, near Dublin]
cleared of the Feens."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> At any rate, whatever its position
in time and place, this battle clearly marks a crisis in the
history of that latter race. For to them the battle of Gawra
was a complete and crushing defeat; and thereafter their
suzerainty was ended. "The kings did all own our sway till
the battle of Gaura was fought," sings the bard of the Feens,
"but since that horrid slaughter no tribute nor tax we've
raised." The chroniclers state that the leader and an
immense number of his warriors were killed, and only two
thousand of the Feens of Ireland were left alive when the
battle was over. And their bard sings thus:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
"Fiercely and bravely we fought,<br />
That fight, the fight of Gaura;<br />
Then did fall our noble Feinn,<br />
Sole to sole with Ireland's kings."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a><br />
</div>

<p>But the Feenian army here engaged did not only consist
of the Feens of Ireland; and this, indeed, is the reason why
attention is now drawn to this battle. It is in regarding the
battle of Gawra that we recognize the force of Dr. Skene's
contention, that however the Feens may in later times have
become restricted to this or that locality, they at one time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
formed a very widely spread <i>race</i>, the various divisions of
which were ready to hasten to the aid of any portion of this
great confederacy in time of danger. Whether Dr. Skene is
precisely correct in stating that "race, and not territory, was
the great bond of association," is a mere question of words.
Because the Gaelic traditions emphatically show that although
Ireland and other neighbouring lands were occupied
by people of non-Feenic race, who were governed by their
own kings, yet, as these kings were <i>themselves</i> subject to the
Feens, who drew tribute from them, the real owners of these
various territories were the powerful though scattered overlords,
and not the races that were under their sway.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Mr.
J. F. Campbell also states that the Feenic king was not
distinguished by any <i>territorial</i> title: "always 'Rìgh na
Fînne or F&#0275;inne'" ("West Highland Tales," I, xiii). And in
the pedigree which he gives on page 34 of his "Leabhar na
Feinne," and which was compiled by a good archæologist, the
title given to three successive generations of the "royal
family" of the Irish Feens is "General of the Feens" of
Ireland; not "King of Ireland" itself.</p>

<p>This battle of Gawra, then, which seems to mark the
period when the great Feenic confederacy was on the point
of breaking up, was brought about by the evident resolve of
the non-Feenic population of Ireland to throw off for ever
this intolerable yoke. And the three verses which Dr. Skene
extracts from the poem descriptive of the battle disclose to
us that other sections of the Feenic confederacy had come to
the help of that division which was resident in Ireland. The
poem is supposed to be sung by a Feen of Ireland; and he
states that</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

"Boinne, the son of Breacal, exclaimed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With quickness, fierceness, and valour,&mdash;</span><br />
'I and the Feens of Britain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Will be with Oscar of Emhain.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"There was thus in this battle," says Dr. Skene, "besides
Feens of Ireland, Feens of Alban, Britain, and Lochlan."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
Alban, he explains, denoted the whole of Scotland lying to
the north of the Forth and Clyde. Britain, he states in this
place, was South-Western Scotland. But elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> he tells
us that "Britain" signified "either Wales, or England and
Wales together"; and again,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> that that term included
"England, Scotland, and Wales." At the very least, then,
it denoted a part of Great Britain, then inhabited&mdash;not
necessarily to the exclusion of other races&mdash;by Feens.</p>

<p>These two names, "Alban" and "Britain," do not, however,
take us outside of the British Isles. But the third term,
"Lochlan," does. "Lochlan," says our guide, "was the
north of Germany, extending from the Rhine to the Elbe."
And the Feens of that territory, the poem tells us, "from
the chief to the leader of nine men," "mustered along with
us [the Feens of Ireland] to share in the struggle," on this
fateful day of Gawra.</p>

<p>Why Dr. Skene should limit "Lochlan" to these dimensions
is not made quite clear. For Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark constituted the "Lochlan" chiefly known to
Gaelic writers. However, he seems to be of opinion that
the term was "transferred" to Scandinavia in the ninth
century, and that previously (as, for example, when the
battle of Gawra was fought) it peculiarly denoted the more
southern territory. If he is right in this, we cannot assume
the Lochlan contingent as including the Feens of Norway.
On the other hand, there does not seem to be any strong
reason for believing that, at the date of Gawra, "Lochlan"
did not take in the whole of Scandinavia, as in the ninth
century and afterwards. It is at least noteworthy, in this
connection, that in the pedigree previously referred to,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the
ruler of the Feens of Ireland, when the battle of Gawra was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
fought, is stated to have been the grandson of a <i>Finland</i>
woman. Quite apart from the assumed identity of <i>Feen</i>
and <i>Finn</i>, this indicates a kinship that was not limited even
by the river Elbe.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>But really the identity of <i>Feen</i> and <i>Finn</i> seems tolerably
clear. Indeed, a contemporary writer,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> who has studied
ancient Ireland and its "Feinne" from his own point of
view, appears to regard this identity as a thing perfectly
manifest. And when, as tending to confirm this opinion, he
embellishes his pages with several illustrations from scientific
authorities in modern Finland, in which the ancient forms
of art and dress are seen, it is plain that these designs are
the same as those which are strongly associated with those
portions of Scotland which were once known as The Land of
the Feens.</p>

<p>Therefore, it appears probable that the "Feinne" of
Lochlan, that is, of the country lying between the Rhine and
the Elbe, who assisted their kindred in Ireland at the battle
of Gawra, were simply the Finns of that territory. And
that, consequently, that battle belongs to a period when the
Mongoloid people, instead of being cut up, as now, into small
detachments here and there, or amalgamated with other
races, held a very distinct and important position throughout
a considerable area of Europe.</p>

<p>However, this identity of "Feen" with "Finn" may not
appear to some people as even a probability, without a fuller
investigation into the circumstances of the people known to
Gaelic tradition as the <i>Feinne</i>. It may therefore be desirable
to continue to refer to the "Finns" of Gaelic folk-lore by
the name of "Feens."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>"The Feens, then, belonged to the pre-Milesian races, and
were connected, not only with Ireland, but likewise with
Northern and Central Scotland, England and Wales, and the
territory lying between the Rhine and the Elbe.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Now,
there are just two people mentioned in the Irish records who
had settlements in Ireland, and who yet were connected with
Great Britain and the region between the Rhine and the
Elbe. These were the people termed the Tuatha De Danann,
and the Cruithné." So says the learned annotator of
"The Dean of Lismore's Book."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>These two last-named races, we are told, are both traditionally
brought from the Elbe and Rhine districts to Ireland
and Scotland, and both are eventually subdued by the later-arriving
Milesian Scots. The period given for the Milesian
conquest of the Cruithné of Scotland, is the ninth century of
the Christian era.</p>

<p>Leaving the "Tuatha De Danann" out of the question in
the meantime, let us look at the contemporary and probably
kindred "Cruithné." The Cruithné, Cruithneach, or Cruithnigh,
are unquestionably deserving of study, for Dr. Skene
has shown us<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> that this is merely another name for those
people whom history chiefly knows as "the Picts." The
traditional "Feens," therefore, are to be identified with the
historical "Picts."</p>

<p>Now, although these people are, as we have just seen,
believed to have come from the Continental country of
"Lochlan" (Scandinavia, in the largest acceptation of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
term, or, in its most restricted sense, the region lying between
the Rhine and the Elbe), and although there is every reason
to believe that they spread themselves all over the British
Isles, yet they seem&mdash;regarded as "Picts"&mdash;to be chiefly
associated with North Britain. Their memory is still preserved,
topographically, by the name of <i>Pentland</i> (formerly
<i>Petland</i> or <i>Pehtland</i>, and <i>Pictland</i>), which is borne by the
stormy firth separating the Orkneys from Caithness, and also
by the range of hills lying to the south of Edinburgh.
Both of these names are unquestionably derived from the
time when there was a "land of the Picts" in either of these
neighbourhoods. But the Picts, as such, are remembered all
over Scotland, in history and in tradition. It is chiefly in
connection with Ireland that they are spoken of as Cruithné.</p>

<p>If the "Feens" of tradition were <i>Cruithné</i>, or <i>Picts</i>, it is
evident that whatever is known with regard to the history,
customs, appearance, and language of the Picts will help us
to decide as to whether the <i>Feens</i> were really one with the
<i>Finns</i> of history, ethnology, and tradition. This, as already
remarked, on general grounds, seems very probable. But,
when a very able historian assures us that the historical
Cruithné or Picts must certainly be at least classed with the
Feens of tradition, if these three terms do not actually include
one people, we are enabled, by proceeding upon this
assumption, to obtain further proofs in corroboration of this
belief.</p>

<p>Whether regarded as Feens or as Picts, these people, we
are informed, had settlements throughout the British Isles
during the earlier centuries of the Christian era, and the
country of their origin was Northern Germany (or, more
vaguely, Scandinavia); in which country large sections of
their kindred continued to dwell, and to maintain a system
of confederacy with the Western or British section long after
the latter had settled in their new home. This, at any rate,
when viewed as Feens.</p>

<p>On the other hand, such a writer as Mr. H. Howorth
demonstrates that, during the same period, the Mongoloid
races formed a most important, and in some places a preponderating,
portion of the inhabitants of the countries of
Northern Europe. But, during that period, these Mongolian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
races have&mdash;he points out&mdash;been subjected to an unceasing
process of expulsion from their neighbours on the south and
south-east. If any race, therefore, arrived in the British
Islands from the neighbourhood of the Baltic in the centuries
immediately preceding or following the birth of Christ, the
probability is that that race belonged to one division or
another of these dispossessed Ugrian people.</p>

<p>If this were so&mdash;if the Cruithné or Picts, who came to
Britain from the Baltic lands, were one with, or closely akin
to, the Finns and Lapps&mdash;their characteristics must have
been those of such people. For example, their religious
beliefs. Now, one cannot read Dr. Skene's references to the
heathen religion of the Cruithné without seeing that it
strongly resembles that of the Lapps and Finns.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Without
quoting these references in detail, it may be pointed out that
the power of bringing on a snowstorm and darkness, and
unfavourable winds, was among the mysteries of the Pictish
priests. And this gift of commanding the elements was
peculiarly associated with the Finns and Lapps, as it still is
with the Eskimo "sorcerers" of Greenland. "In the Middle
Ages," says a writer on sorcery,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> "the name of <i>Finn</i> was
equivalent to sorcerer." And as the same writer observes
that "the old authors often confounded the Finns with the
Lapps, and when they speak of Finns, it is very difficult to
know which of these two peoples they refer to" (a confusion
of terms which we have already had occasion to remark), we
may here use the term <i>Finn</i> to denote both divisions. Tentatively,
at any rate. The actual Lapps appear to have been
the most powerful magicians of all that caste. "It is proved
by numerous documents," continues M. Tuchmann, "that
the Finns called the Lapps sorcerers, although they themselves
were reputed to be great magicians; but they regarded
themselves as inferior to their neighbours, for they habitually
said, when speaking of their most famous sorcerers: 'He is
a veritable Lapp.'"<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> However, since "Finn" has so frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
been used to denote the whole group, and since the
most recent examples of these people in the British Isles,
namely, the magic-working Finns of Shetland, have borne
that title, we may adhere to the practice of referring to both
divisions as "Finns."</p>

<p>The Picts or Cruithné, therefore, practised the magic of
the Finns. That is, the <i>Feens</i> practised the magic of the
<i>Finns</i>.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Again, when we look at certain weapons used by the
<i>Feens</i>, a similar resemblance is visible. According to a tradition,
taken down from the recital of an old Hebridean, the
spears or darts of the Feens, which were known in Gaelic as
"<i>tunnachan</i>," were of this description: "They were sticks
with sharp ends made on them, and these ends burned
and hardened in the fire. They [the Feens] used to throw
them from them, and they could aim exceedingly with them,
and they could drive them through a man. They used to
have a bundle with them on their shoulders, and a bundle in
their oxters [under their arm-pits]. I myself have seen one
of them that was found in a moss, that was as though it had
been hardened in the fire."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> "This, then," justly remarks
Mr. Campbell, "gives the popular notion of the heroes [the
Feens], and throws them back beyond the iron period."</p>

<p>While the fashion of referring to "periods" of iron,
bronze, etc., is very apt to mislead (since contiguous peoples
have been, and are, in different "periods" of this nature, at
the same moment of time), it is at least clear from the above
tradition that the most primitive form of dart was associated
with the Feens. But, although this species of weapon is of
great antiquity, it does not follow that a tradition which
relates to people who employed it, is necessarily of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
antiquity also. Or that those javelin-men were at all "prehistoric."
We have already seen that a race of people
employed darts in exactly the same way when fishing&mdash;or,
perhaps, more correctly, when seal-hunting&mdash;within British
waters, only two hundred years ago. And the people who
in this respect resembled the <i>Feens</i> of Gaelic folk-lore are
themselves remembered as <i>Finns</i>.</p>

<p>But perhaps the readiest and surest way of obtaining
something like a true conception of these legendary Feens,
is to regard them from the ethnological point of view, as
well, that is, as our imperfect information will allow. We
shall therefore look at them in this aspect, whether considered
as <i>Picts</i> or <i>Cruithné</i> or as <i>Feens</i>.</p>

<p>The great hero of the Feenic legends, and the "King" or
"General" of the Feens of Ireland, was the famous "Finn"
or "Fionn." If the battle of Gawra was really fought in
the third century, as is alleged, and if this "Fionn" was a
real man, and not the type or "eponymus" of his race, then
he ought to be assigned to the third century. For he is
said to have been present at that battle, where his grandson
was slain and the supremacy of his race destroyed. At any
rate, whether he lived at that date or not, and whether he
was an individual or merely a personification of his race,
Fionn figures throughout the tales of these people as a very
Feen of the Feens.</p>

<p>Now, among the many stories told of him, there is one,
entitled "How Fin<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> went to the Kingdom of the Big Men."
It is unnecessary to give all the particulars of this tale. But
Fin is pictured as starting from Dublin Bay in his little
coracle (<i>curachan</i>) on his voyage to the country of the Big
Men. Although he is described as "hoisting the spotted,
towering sails," they cannot have been very large, or very
many, for the coracle was so small that "Fin was guide in
her prow, helm in her stern, and tackle in her middle," and
when he landed on the coast of the Big Men's country, he
drew his tiny vessel, unaided, up into the dry grass, above
the tide-mark. It ought to be added, however, that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
coracle was an open boat, capable of holding at least four
persons; as is shown on the return voyage.</p>

<p>After landing, Fin encountered a "big wayfarer" (<i>tais-dealach
mòr</i>), who informed him that his king had long been
in want of a dwarf (<i>troich</i>), and that Fin would suit him
capitally. "He took with him Fin; but another big man
(<i>fear mòr</i>) came, and was going to take Fin from him. The
two fought; but when they had torn each other's clothes,
they left it to Fin to judge. He chose the first one. He
took Fin with him to the palace of the king, whose worthies
and high nobles assembled to see the little man (<i>an duine
bhig</i>"). And then and there Fin was installed as the royal
dwarf.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>In this story, then, we have the tacit admission that, not
far from Fin's home at the hill of Allen, Kildare, there was a
country whose inhabitants were so much taller than the race
of Fin, that the latter were mere dwarfs beside them. Now,
this is precisely <i>the most striking</i> characteristic of the kayak-using
Finns of Shetlandic tradition.</p>

<p>The <i>Finns</i> of Shetland folk-lore are, says Mr. Karl Blind,
"reckoned among the <i>Trows</i>." The king of the <i>Feens</i> was
hailed in the country of the big men as a <i>Troich</i>. And these
are simply two forms of the same word. <i>Troich</i> or <i>droich</i>,
among Gaelic-speaking people, is softened into <i>trow</i> or <i>drow</i>
among the English-speaking Shetlanders.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In both cases it
signifies "dwarf."</p>

<p>And, just as the Shetlanders have memories of a race of
small men, who, in spite of their mean stature, were a terror
to the taller people, whom they oppressed and took tribute
from, so have the Gaelic-speaking people a mass of legends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
which also tell of similar dwarfish but dreaded tyrants. The
former designate their dwarfs "Finns": if the Gaelic traditions
are not equally definite, they at least suggest that a
caste of "Feens," who levied a tax upon the Gaelic-speaking
people, were themselves dwarfs in stature. And the Highland
tales abound in stories of fierce and tyrannical dwarfs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>But, if the legendary "Feens" are identical with, or closely
akin to, the Picts of history, then the historical Picts must
also belong to this stunted Eskimo-like race. Let us look
at the people called "Picts."</p>

<p>And, first of all, since the word "Pict" is admittedly the
result of a pun or a misapprehension on the part of Latin-speaking
people, it may be as well to discard that special
spelling. The forms which the word appears to have most
commonly taken in the mouths of the country-people of
Scotland are <i>Pik</i>, <i>Pech</i>, <i>Pecht</i>, and <i>Peht</i> (the <i>ch</i> being of
course pronounced as in German). Doubtless, other forms
might be adduced; but perhaps the best compromise is
<i>Pecht</i>. What, then, are the accounts given with regard to
the stature of the Pechts?</p>

<p>The question is practically answered at once in considering
the nature of the dwellings that the traditions of Scotland
unanimously assign to these people.</p>

<p>"The only tradition which I heard current on the subject
of the former inhabitants of the country," says a writer on
Shetland,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> "was, that the remains of old dwellings were
Pechts' houses, and that those who lived in them were little
men." And, in reporting to the Anthropological Society of
London the result of an archæological tour in Shetland, Dr.
James Hunt<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> remarks of such "old dwellings"&mdash;"These
remains are called 'Pights' or Picts' houses.' Mr. Umfray
[a local archæologist] surmises that they were originally
'pights' or dwarfs' houses.' Dwarfs, in this locality, are still
called <i>pechts</i>."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> And the present writer, when visiting a "Pict's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
house" three or four miles north of the place just spoken of,
and which had also been inspected by Dr. Hunt, obtained
similar testimony. The place is known as Saffester, or
Seffister, and its antiquarian features consist of the remains
of a chambered tumulus and a separate subterranean gallery.
The latter is referred to by one writer as a "Pict's house,"
although it is only a passage. As, however, local tradition
alleges that it leads to the chambered mound, the name may
be correct enough. Now, this tumulus was opened fifty or
more years ago by the parish minister.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> And an old man,
who was then a boy, informed the writer that the entrance
was effected by what he and his boy companions had always
called "the <i>trow's</i> door." Another similar experience of the
writer's yields a like result. Near Hamna Voe, at the south
end of the island of Yell, there is a small loch and islet,
with the remains of a "broch," the loch being known as "the
loch of Kettlester." The "broch" that once stood there
(for the ruins no longer retain their original shape) was built
by "the Pechts," said the intelligent lad (a native of the
district) who was the writer's guide, and these Pechts he
described as very small people.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The popular Shetland notions regarding the Pechts are
again repeated by a lady writer, who has the advantage of
being herself a Shetlander<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>: "The first folks that ever were
in our isles were the Picts.... They had no ships, only
small boats.... They were very small [people]." Indeed, so
much has their small stature been impressed upon the popular
memory, that, as we have seen, "dwarfs, in this locality, are
still called <i>pechts</i>." Nor is it only in Shetland that this word
has such a meaning. In Aberdeenshire <i>picht</i> denotes a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
dwarfish person, and Dr. Jamieson, in recording the fact,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
suggests its connection with "the <i>pichts</i> or <i>pechts</i>, whom the
vulgar view as a race of pigmies." In the south of Scotland
also, this signification appears to prevail; for the Ettrick
Shepherd, in the "Noctes Ambrosianæ," employs "pegh" as
an everyday synonym for "dwarf." In point of fact, although
it has just been stated that dwarfs "are still called <i>pechts</i>" in
Shetland, because of the small size of the race so known to
history, it is really a question whether the historical people
did not so become historically remembered <i>because</i> a pre-existing
word fitly described their dwarfish stature. But
this etymological point is of little importance here.</p>

<p>Although Shetland has been chiefly considered in these
recent remarks, it will be seen that the popular belief regarding
the stature of the Pechts is apparently common to the
whole of Scotland. Dr. Jamieson evidently thought so when
he referred to "the Pichts, or Pechts, whom the vulgar view
as a race of pigmies." And he does not stand alone.
"Throughout Scotland," says another writer, "the vulgar
account is 'that the <i>Pechs</i> were unco wee bodies, but terrible
strang'; that is, that they were of very small stature, but of
prodigious strength."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> "Long ago," quotes the late Robert
Chambers,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and his quotation also applies to the whole of
Scotland, "there were people in this country called the
Pechs; short, wee men they were,"&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show that the ideas held by the
"vulgar" (whose traditions, once contemptuously rejected by
scholars, are nowadays being rated at their true value),
throughout Scotland, with respect to the Pechts, agree in
describing those people as decidedly dwarfish in stature.
And this belief is most convincingly borne out by the
dwellings which the Pechts are believed to have inhabited;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the "Pechts' houses" which we glanced at a few paragraphs
back, and which speedily led us to consider the Pechts themselves.
No man of the average height of modern British
people, who has personally inspected these "Pechts' houses,"
can arrive at any other conclusion than that they were built
and inhabited by people of a stature very much less than
his own. This is a point so manifest that it need not be
emphasized to those who have stooped, squeezed, and crept
among the chambers and passages of a "Pictish broch."
A few particulars of measurement would quickly convince
others; but such details need not be entered into here.
However, something may be said with regard to the appearance
of the dwelling which may best be regarded as the
typical "Pecht's house."</p>

<p>In a "Notice of the Brochs and the so-called Picts' Houses
of Orkney," submitted to the Anthropological Society of
London,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Mr. George Petrie points out that "the name Pict's
house is applied indiscriminately, in the northern counties of
Scotland, to every sort of ancient structure." And as there
is certainly a great difference, in degree, between the various
structures referred to, we may here accept Mr. Petrie's
guidance as to what constitutes the typical "Pict's house."
"The class of buildings to which I have for many years restricted
the appellation of <i>Picts' house</i> have been," says Mr.
Petrie, "very different from the brochs,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> both in external
appearance and general structure and arrangements. The
<i>Pict's house</i> is generally of a conical form, and externally
closely resembles a large bowl-shaped barrow. It consists of
a solid mass of masonry, covered with a layer of turf, a foot
or more in thickness, and has a central chamber surrounded
by several smaller cells. The entrance to the central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
chamber from the outside is by a long, low, narrow passage;
while the cells are connected with the chamber by short
passages of similar dimensions to the long one. The walls
of the chambers and cells converge towards the top, where
they approach so closely that the aperture can be spanned
by a stone a couple of feet in length."</p>

<p>Another writer<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> describes a Pict's house&mdash;that on Wideford
Hill, near Kirkwall&mdash;in these terms: "All that meets
the eye at first is a green, conical mound, with an indescribable
aspect of something <i>eerie</i> and weird about it, resting
silently amid the moorland solitude. On closer inspection
we discover an entrance passage, about eighteen inches high
and two feet broad, leading from the lower side into the
interior of the prehistoric dwelling,"&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p>The resemblance between this kind of dwelling, or its more
modern representative, the "bee-hive" hut of the Hebrides
and Western Ireland, to the dwellings of modern Eskimos
has long been recognized. But it may be permitted to quote
here from the accounts given by two Arctic voyagers of the
early part of this century, especially as these accounts, both
relating to the most northern tribes of Greenland, appear to
describe with peculiar exactness the "Pict's house" of Mr.
Petrie.</p>

<p>Captain Scoresby, in the account of his explorations in
the year 1822, thus describes the deserted dwellings of some
of those northern Eskimos:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The roofs of all the huts had either been removed or had fallen in;
what remained, consisted of an excavation in the ground at the brow of
the bank, about 4 feet in depth, 15 in length, and 6 to 9 in width. The
sides of each hut were sustained by a wall of rough stones, and the
bottom appeared to be gravel, clay, and moss. The access to these huts,
after the manner of the Esquimaux, was a horizontal tunnel perforating
the ground, about 15 feet in length, opening at one extremity on the side
of the bank, into the external air, and, at the other, communicating with
the interior of the hut. This tunnel was so low, that a person must
creep on his hands and knees to get into the dwelling: it was roofed with
slabs of stone and sods. This kind of hut being deeply sunk in the
earth, and being accessible only by a subterranean passage, is generally
considered as formed altogether under ground. As, indeed, it rises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
very little above the surface, and as the roof, when entire, is generally
covered with sods, and clothed with moss or grass, it partakes so much
of the appearance of the rest of the ground, that it can scarcely be
distinguished from it. I was much struck by its admirable adaptation
to the nature of the climate and the circumstances of the inhabitants.
The uncivilized Esquimaux, using no fire in these habitations, but only
lamps, which serve both for light and for warming their victuals, require,
in the severities of winter, to economise, with the greatest care, such
artificial warmth as they are able to produce in their huts. For this
purpose, an under-ground dwelling, defended from the penetration of
the frost by a roof of moss and earth, with an additional coating of
a bed of snow, and preserved from the entrance of the piercing wind
by a long subterranean tunnel, without the possibility of being annoyed
by any draught of air, but what is voluntarily admitted&mdash;forms one of
the best contrivances which, considering the limited resources, and
the unenlightened state of these people, could possibly have been
adopted."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Scoresby's description fully corroborates that given by
Captain Ross a few years earlier, when relating his visit to
the Eskimos living about the north-eastern corner of Baffin's
Bay. These people he describes as "short in stature, seldom
exceeding five feet," and he mentions that their sorcerers
alleged that it was in their power to raise a storm or make a
calm, and to drive off seals and birds."</p>

<p>With regard to their dwellings, he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"None of their houses were seen, but they described them as built
entirely of stone, the walls being sunk about three feet into the earth,
and raised about as much above it. They have no windows, and the
entrance is by a long, narrow passage, nearly under ground. Several
families live in one house, and each has a lamp made of hollowed stone,
hung from the roof, in which they burn the blubber of the seal, etc.,
using dried moss for a wick, which is kindled by means of iron and stone.
This lamp, which is never extinguished, serves at once for light,
warmth, and cooking."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is not out of place to refer here also to an instructive article
on "The Archæology of Lighting Appliances," read before
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland by Mr. J. Romilly
Allen, F.S.A.Scot., in the course of which he describes the
stone lamps found in the habitations known as "brochs"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
(and popularly assigned to the Picts), with regard to which
lamps he states that although not quite identical in shape
with those used by modern Eskimos, they are substantially
identical, and must have been used in precisely the same
way. Comparing this with Baron Nordenskiöld's accounts,
Mr. Romilly Allen observes: "The picture here given of
the domestic life of the Eskimos at the present time enables
us to form a tolerably correct idea of the way in which the
inhabitants of the Scottish brochs lighted their dwellings
during the long winter nights two thousand years ago."
("Proceedings of Soc. of Antiq. of Scot." 1887-88, p. 84.)</p>

<p>From all these remarks, then, it will be seen that the
dwelling of the dwarfish Eskimo and the "house" assigned
by Scottish tradition to the Pechts, or dwarfs, are substantially
one. And a consideration of the statements also
demonstrates clearly that, whatever the age of the word
"pecht," none but a race of dwarfish stature would have
built such places of abode. Indeed, the stature of the
dwellers in the Pecht's house is doubly impressed upon the
memory of the Northern Islanders. When Mr. Gorrie describes
its outward appearance, he tells us (in similar terms
to the Arctic voyagers), that "all that meets the eye at first
is a green, conical mound ... resting silently amid the
moorland solitude." But he really repeats himself, although
he is not aware of it, when he refers on another page<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> to
"the simple superstition (?) long prevalent among the inhabitants
of Orkney and Zetland, that the strange green
mounds rising by the sea-side and on solitary moors, were
the abodes of supernatural beings known by the name of
Trows." Of the "supernatural" attributes assigned to those
people, or claimed by them&mdash;in early Scotland, in Lapland,
and in Greenland&mdash;much remains to be said. But the
people just referred to under two different, but synonymous,
names, are undoubtedly one and the same.</p>

<p>The Pechts of history, then, were a race of dwarfs. Thus,
when Dr. Skene identifies the Feens of Gaelic folk-lore with
the historic Pechts, he reveals them to us as a race of dwarfs.
Therefore, the traditional story of the Feen chiefs visit to the
"country of the big men," where he was regarded by that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
latter race as a "droich," is entirely in accordance with Dr.
Skene's belief that the Feens were of the same race as the
historic Pechts. It is not at all unlikely that this identity
was taken for granted long before the nineteenth century,
and in Scotland. In Allan Ramsay's <i>Evergreen</i>, a collection
of Scottish poems written before the year 1600, there is a
certain "Interlude of the Droichs," also referred to as "The
Droichs' Part of a Play." Now, the spokesman of these
droichs (or trows, or dwarfs) announces himself as a grandson
of Fin, the great chief of the Feens of Ireland. And he
makes a statement which is identical with one contained in
a Feenic poem on the battle of Gawra. This statement need
not be particularized here, but it tells us unmistakably that
these "droichs" were regarded as the representatives of Fin
and his Feens.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Therefore, it would appear from this poem
that Fin and his Feens were regarded by the ruling class in
Scotland, prior to 1600, as dwarfs. That is, as <i>pechts</i>.</p>

<p>So far, then, all that has here been said tends to show that
the <i>Feinne</i> of Gaelic folk-lore, and the Finns of Northern
history and tradition, ought to be regarded as one and the
same people. And that one section, at any rate, of such
people ought to be identified with the Pechts, or Picts, of
history.</p>

<p>While the Picts, or Pechts, are remembered to a great extent
as the builders of the subterranean and half-subterranean
dwellings with which they are associated, these are far from
being the only structures which popular tradition has stamped
as the work of their hands. The architectural skill, of a
kind, which they displayed in the construction of their own
"Pechts' houses" may be seen from such a casual reference
as this, gleaned from among certain specimens of Clydesdale
folk-lore: "Our milkhouse," says a Clydesdale peasant,
"whilk stude on the side of a dentie burn, and was ane o' thae
auld vowts [vaults] whilk the Pechs biggit langsyne, had wa's
sae doons strang that ane waud hae thocht it micht hae
stude to the last day; but its found had been onnerminit
by the last Lammas-spait."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> If the "Pechts' houses" lacked,
as they certainly did, evidences of high culture in the
designers, or outward beauty of design in themselves, they
were at least remarkable for their great strength and
durability; so that, were it not for such accidents as a
Lammas-flood, they might well have stood "to the last
day." But the great bodily strength of this race, and
their turn for masonry, were made use of in other ways
than in the construction of the dwellings referred to; that
is, if there is any truth in the popular ideas upon this subject.</p>

<p>The late Robert Chambers, in putting together the
popular Scotch beliefs regarding these people,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> not only
states that they were "short, wee men," but he adds, still
speaking as a Scottish peasant: "The Pechs were great
builders; they built a' the auld castles in the kintry; and
do ye ken the way they built them? I'll tell ye. They
stood all in a row from the quarry to the place where they
were building, and ilk ane handed forward the stanes to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
neebor, till the hale was biggit." A special example of one
of the buildings so reared is the Round Tower of Abernethy
in Perthshire, well known as one of the two towers of this
class still to be found in Scotland. "The story goes," says
the Rev. Andrew Small, in his "Antiquities of Fife,"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> "that it
was built by the Pechts,... and that, while the work was
going on, they stood in a row all the way from the Lomond
Hill to the building, handing the stones from one to another....
That it has been built of freestone from the
Lomond Hill is clear to a demonstration, as the grist or
nature of the stone points out the very spot where it has
been taken from, namely, a little west, and up from the
ancient wood of Drumdriell, about a mile straight south from
Meralsford." That Abernethy was long a seat of Pictish
power is what no historian would deny, and the tower referred
to is always denominated "Pictish." Of the way in
which it was built we have just seen the local account.</p>

<p>Similar ideas are current in Northumberland. "The
erection of several of these old castles [<i>e.g.</i>, Dunstanborough
Castle] is, by popular tradition, ascribed to the Picts....
The building of the Roman wall, which is by country people
commonly called the Picts' wall, is also ascribed to them;
and they are said to have formed the Catrail on the Scottish
border, which is frequently called the Picts-work ditch. The
Picts are described as men of low stature, but of superhuman
strength; and on the moors of Northumberland the heaps
of stone, which are supposed by antiquaries to mark the spot
where 'bones of mighty chiefs lie hid,' are sometimes pointed
out to the inquiring stranger as places where a Pict's apron-string
had broken as he was carrying a load of stones to his
work."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Although the tower at Abernethy, and the "Pechts' houses"
already spoken of, may be classed together as having been
built for the use of the builders themselves, it is quite evident
that if these people actually reared the many other structures
attributed to them, in Scotland and in Northumberland, they
did so in the character of serfs, working for people of other
races. If Dunstanborough Castle, the Wall of Hadrian, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
(perhaps also) the Catrail, not to speak of "a' the auld castles
in the kintry," were built by the Pechts, the builders were
evidently not working on their own behalf. This clearly
must have been the case in the instance of the "Roman Wall,"
which was raised for the very purpose of checking the southward
inroads of these fierce warriors. That it actually was a
"Roman wall" is of course beyond question. But that fact
does not interfere with the supposition that the drudgery
was performed by captive Pechts, whose immense strength,
and intimate acquaintance with the art of building such
structures, would render them of the greatest use to their
conquerors. That they, and not the Romans, were the actual
<i>builders</i> of the wall, as Northumbrian tradition asserts, is
therefore far from improbable. Indeed, there are one or two
indications that the more northern "Wall of Antoninus"
may also have been reared by kindred hands. And as with
these early examples, so may the later buildings referred to
have actually been unwillingly built by Pechts, at the command
of other people.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Not only walls and castles, or towers, but churches and
cathedrals are also said to have been reared by the same
dwarfish but powerful builders, as may be seen from the
following instances.</p>

<p>One part of Scotland that continued to be a "reservation"
of the Pechts, after that people had ceased to hold sway, is
the hilly country lying to the south of Edinburgh, and known
as "the Pentlands." Like the "Pentland Firth" on the
north-east of Scotland, this district was so called because it
was associated with the Pechts. We need not here concern
ourselves as to the causes which made the name, in both
instances, assume the modern form of "Pentland." But, in
each case, the name was formerly "Pehtland," and it signified
"the land of the Pehts, or Pechts." According to Dr. Skene,
the Angles of Northumbria had, as early as the seventh
century, established themselves pretty securely as the ruling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
caste throughout the south-east of what is now Scotland, then a
part of "Northumbria." This territory seems to have reached
as far on the north-west as the modern county of Linlithgow,
and one of the chief Northumbrian strongholds in that
neighbourhood has ever since been known by the name of
the Northumbrian king, Edwin. Edinburgh, therefore, in the
seventh century, appears as a seat of the Anglian race, which
ruled from the Forth to the Humber. Three or four centuries
later, the steadily growing power of "Scotia" annexed the
whole of Northumbria lying north of the Borders. But the
population, no doubt, remained little affected by this political
change, and its speech and traditions continued the same.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>But, although those Angles were the rulers of south-eastern
Scotland (in modern topography), there still remained
a remnant of the Pechts in at least one part of that northern
Northumbria.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> And it was because of their residence there
that the Angles spoke of the hilly region lying to the south
and south-west of Edinburgh as "the Peht or Pecht land."
How long the Pechts maintained some kind of individuality
in that neighbourhood it is impossible to say. It is said
that, after Kenneth's great victory over the Pechts at Forteviot
or at Scone, in the middle of the ninth century, many of the
fugitives sought refuge in England. And, as the Pentland
Hills were then in "England," it is likely that they found
shelter among their kindred there. In other parts of Scotland
the Pechts are historically visible long after the seventh and
ninth centuries. At the battle of the Standard, in 1138, the
Galloway section formed one division of the Scottish army.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
A popular tradition, to be presently referred to, also speaks
of them as a distinct people in the Clyde valley, during
the same century. It is therefore quite permissible to
suppose that, once the people of the Midlothian "Pecht-lands"
had realized that they were a conquered remnant,
with no hope of ultimately recovering their lost power, they
may have continued to live, if merely as serfs, not only to
the twelfth century, but for several centuries longer.</p>

<p>That they did so is to be inferred from the following bit of
"folk-lore," which relates to a locality that, though not
strictly included in the district of the "Pecht-lands," is quite
near enough to agree with this hypothesis.</p>

<p>The hill of Corstorphine, situated a little to the west of
Edinburgh, is only about three miles north of the nearest
point of the "Pecht-lands." Now, the village church of
Corstorphine is one of the few churches in Scotland which
are of interest to the antiquary. "Ancient it most unquestionably
is," says a modern writer in the course of a description
of the village and its church, and the foundation of the
latter is placed in the year 1429. The fifteenth century is
not very "ancient," as these things go, but perhaps the site
has been occupied by a church from a much earlier period.
At any rate, the writer just referred to, in visiting Corstorphine
for the purpose of inspecting both church and village,
obtained this piece of local tradition, believed to relate to
the church of 1429. "Of this [church], in November 1881,
an intelligent native assured the writer that it was 'wonderfully
ancient, built by the Hottentots, who stood in a row
and handed the stones on one to another from Ravelston
quarry'"&mdash;on the adjacent hill of Corstorphine.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Now, if one compares this account with the traditional
description of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Pechts, already instanced
in the case of Abernethy, and generally accepted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
throughout Scotland, one hardly requires the historical testimony
of the "Pecht-lands" to recognize in these "Hottentots"
the Pechts of tradition. It is not necessary to take the expression
here used by the Corstorphine villager as absolutely
correct. His statement, it may be remarked, succeeded a
conversation in which our various wars in South Africa had
been discussed,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and it is not unlikely that this had suggested
to the speaker the term "Hottentot" as aptly enough describing
a race that to his ancestors, whose ideas he inherited,
had seemed savage and inferior. That he absolutely believed
the labourers who reared the walls of the church to be of a
different race from his own is unquestionably indicated by
the whole tenor of his remarks.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>This Corstorphine tradition points to a body of Pechts
still surviving as a distinct type, in the Midlothian of 1429;
and then regarded by the general population as a caste of
drudges. This, too, is the position accorded to that race in
one phase of Highland tradition. "I am informed," says
Dr. Jamieson,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> "that in Inverness-shire, the foundations of
various houses have been discovered, of a round form,...
and that when the Highlanders are asked to whom they
belonged, they say that they were the houses of the <i>Drinnich</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
or <i>Trinnich</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, of the <i>labourers</i>, a name which they give to
the Picts." They may be seen in the Clyde valley, in the
same position as those of Corstorphine, but three centuries
earlier, on the testimony of tradition. "Throughout Scotland,"
says an antiquary previously quoted, "the vulgar
account is, 'that the <i>Pechs</i> were unco wee bodies, but terrible
strang'; that is, that they were of very small stature,
but of prodigious strength. It is commonly added [he
goes on] 'that the meal (oatmeal) was a penny the peck
when they built the <i>Hie</i> Kirk [the Cathedral] of Glasgow;'
for the building of all the cathedrals, and in
general everything very ancient, is ascribed by the common
people to the <i>Pechs</i>."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Now, the present Cathedral
of Glasgow is said to have been built in the twelfth century,
at which date the Pechts of Galloway formed a distinct and
separate population in south-western Scotland. According
to Reginald of Durham, as we have already seen, the town
of Kirkcudbright was situated in the "Pecht-lands" (<i>terra
Pictorum</i>), and the <i>sermo Pictorum</i> was still spoken there.
In the same century the Galloway Pechts formed the van of
the Scottish army at the battle of the Standard; and the
Pechts of this period are remembered in the popular memory,
assisted by a homely enough detail, as having been employed
in the building of the "High Church" of Glasgow. Of course,
the Clyde valley is not situated in Galloway; but the presence
of Pechts in twelfth-century Glasgow may easily be
explained by assuming that they belonged to another detachment
of the race, or that it was worth while sending to
Galloway for such famous builders. Belonging to a period
less easily defined are the Pecht masons of the famous Round
Tower at Brechin. Regarding this tower a local writer states:
"Tradition, in Brechin, as well as at Abernethy, ascribes the
erection to the <i>Peghts</i>," and he adds, that "it has stated they
were only allowed a trifle for this work, and were cheated
out of part of this trifle."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In this instance, also, the Pechts
are remembered as working for people of another race;
which is somewhat remarkable, as the tower itself is one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
those which seem to have been built by the Pechts for <i>their
own</i> purposes.</p>

<p>Without going much out of the way, it may be as well to
point out that the popular idea of the Pechts being "men of
low stature, <i>but of superhuman strength</i>," "unco wee bodies,
<i>but terrible strang</i>," is not only supported by tradition on
every side, but it is borne out by a consideration of the
mementos they have left behind them. Much could be said
on this subject; but it will perhaps be enough here to point
to a hill-fortress in Forfarshire, which history and tradition
agree in ascribing to these people. This is the stronghold
known as the White Cater Thun, situated a few miles north-west
of Brechin (which possesses the Pictish round-tower
just referred to, and which was once a seat of Pictish monarchy).
The fort crowns a hill which rises about 300 feet
above the general level of the great valley of Strathmore,
and is thus referred to:</p>

<blockquote><p>"This is, perhaps, the strongest Pictish fortification extant. It is surrounded
by a double rampart of an elliptical figure, being 436 feet long
by about 200 broad, and containing about two imperial acres.... But
the most wonderful thing that occurs in this Pictish fort is the extraordinary
dimensions of the ramparts, composed entirely of large, loose stones,
being 26 feet thick at the top, and upwards of 100 at the bottom, reckoning
quite to the ditch, which, indeed, seems to be much filled up with
the tumbling down of the walls. The vast labour that it must have cost
to amass so enormous a quantity of large stones, and convey them to
such a height, is astonishing.... In conveying the enormous quantity
of large stones to the summit of White Cater Thun, the natives must
doubtless have expended great labour, and much time. They seem,
however, to have been familiar with a method of removing immense
masses from considerable distances, and it is supposed they made use of
hurdles on such occasions; it is not improbable they might have some
kind of rude windlass for raising the larger stones from the bottom to
the top of the hill."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever the method employed by the builders of this
stronghold, the description just given will show the reader,
what he cannot fail to be impressed with on a study of the
Pechts, that these people and their buildings belonged to
what is known as the "Cyclopean" type, and that they&mdash;the
people&mdash;represented a race now quite extinct, in its purity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
but which must undoubtedly have been remarkable for a
prodigious strength of body, a strength that may well be
spoken of as "superhuman," if it is to be compared with
that of any existing race of men. It is this point that must
always be borne in mind when one considers the traditions
regarding the buildings of the Pechts, and this it is that
justifies the very parts of those traditions which would otherwise
appear utterly wild and incredible. Beyond question,
there is much that demands criticism and inquiry in the
traditional description of the way in which such edifices as
Abernethy Tower and Corstorphine Church were reared.
But two important points must not be overlooked. The one
is that an immense number of people may have been simultaneously
at work; the other is that the workers were of
vast muscular strength.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>In the immediately preceding pages we have been considering
the people known as "Pechts." But it is contended that
the "Feens" of Gaelic story ought to be identified with the
"Pechts." When the leader of the "Feens" landed in "the
country of the big men," he was at once seized upon as
eminently fitted to be the court dwarf, into which office he
was duly installed; from which it was reasonably inferred
that he was a "pegh," or dwarf. Now, in one of the many
songs ascribed to the son of this "pegh," Oisin, who is ever
bemoaning the departed glories of his race, he laments the
fact that he finds himself in his old age "wearily dragging
stones along to the church on the hill of the priest." "Here,
where he is a drudge, he has seen the Feinne in their glory....
Were they alive, shavelings would not hold this
mound." Thus laments Oisin, the representative of the old
heathen Feens, bitter in his denunciations of Patrick the
priest, and the new order which he represents, and ever
bewailing the vanished "glory of the Feinn."</p>

<p>We find Oisin, therefore, accepted universally as the type
of his race, unwillingly occupied in "dragging stones for
priests to build churches," in his old age and after the downfall
of his people. Nor was it only as the serf of another
race that he had so worked; because, he explains to Patrick
that this old age of drudgery had been foretold to him by
his leader, Fin, on a previous occasion, before the coming of
Patrick, and on that occasion not only Oisin, but a great
number of the Feens of Ireland, were engaged in a similar
task. The great difference was that then they were not
working as the drudges of another people, but for themselves,
and at the command of their leader. And it was not a
church, but a hill-fortress, that they were building, "on
Cuailgne's bare and rounded hill." Oisin speaks of it as
Fin's "famous fort," and the hill on which it was built is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
"said to be in the county of Armagh," or, as another writer
states, in County Louth. According to Oisin, two-thirds of
the materials for the fort were brought thither by the Feens
of Connaught and the west of Ireland, and the remainder
by the Feens of Leinster and the east of Ulster, to which
section both Oisin and Fin belonged. Assuming these
traditional accounts to be correct, we thus see the Feens,
in the day of their independence, "dragging stones" to
the top of a hill, in order to build a fortress; and later on
we see them, personified by Oisin, occupied in a similar
manner, but as the drudges of Christian priests and the
builders of Christian churches. The one account applies
to Scotland and the other to Ireland; but the Pechts of the
White Cater Thun have their counterparts in the Feens who
reared the "famous fort" "on Cuailgne's bare and rounded
hill;" and the Pechts who built the churches of Glasgow
and Corstorphine are also duplicated in the conquered Feens,
"weary dragging stones for priests to build churches," in
Ireland. Consequently, the traditional fame of the Pechts
of Scotland, as a great race of builders, is not at all at variance
with the belief that they and the Feens were of one
nation.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>But, if Fin and his Feens were builders of the hill-forts of
the "Pechts," and were themselves veritable Pechts, it is
evident that the Feens built and inhabited the dwellings
known as "Pechts' houses." This is quite borne out when
we regard that class of building which, although an archæologist
already quoted (Mr. Petrie) does not hold it to be
strictly entitled to the designation of "Pecht's house," is
nevertheless a variety of the same species, and often receives
the same title. The variety referred to differs from what has
been accepted as the true "Pecht's house," in that it has no
superimposed covering of earth or turf. But the two
varieties undoubtedly belong to the same general class.
Now, with regard to this second order of "Pecht's house,"
we have such a statement as the following: "Glenlyon, in
Perthshire, is remarkable for the great number of remains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
aboriginal works scattered through it, in the shape of circular
castles built entirely of dry stones. The common people
believe these structures to have belonged to their mythic
hero, Fion,... and have a verse to that effect:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
'Bha da chaisteal dheug aig Fionn<br />
Ann an Crom-ghleann-nan-clach.'<br />
</div>

<p>That is, <i>Fion had twelve castles in the Crooked Glen of Stones</i>
(such being an old name for Glenlyon)."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> And a like belief
prevails in other Perthshire glens, such as Glenshee and
Glenalmond, beside the latter of which, as every reader of
Wordsworth knows, Oisin himself is said to be buried.</p>

<p>The true "Pecht's house," however, is not this dry-stone
circular "castle," open to air and sun. These "castles" are,
indeed, popularly included among "Pechts' houses," but
such an archæologist as the one recently referred to prefers
to speak of them as "brochs." This word "broch" (akin to
<i>burgh</i>, etc.) has been adopted by Dr. Joseph Anderson and
other eminent students of such buildings, to distinguish this
special structure; and although, etymologically regarded, the
distinction is arbitrary, it is very convenient. But the
"broch," standing visibly exposed like any other ruin, its
stone walls uncovered to the sun, is by no means the same
thing as the "Pecht's house" described by Mr. Petrie and
others. This, it may be remembered, is almost or altogether
identical with the dwellings of the North-Greenland Eskimos,
as portrayed by the explorers of seventy years ago. It is
approached through a long, dark tunnel, entered from the
face of a bank or brae, so low that one has to crawl along it,
its sides and roofs composed of large stone slabs, and the
roof itself flush with, or even underneath, the surface of the
ground. At the end of this long, dark, narrow passage one
enters the central chamber of the dwelling of the North-Greenlander
and the ancient Pecht. It, too, would be in
darkness, were it not for the rude stone lamp, fed with the
oil of seal or whale, soaking through moss or the pith of
rushes, which hangs from the roof and is always burning.
Here and there at the side of this central chamber are openings
in the wall which lead into small cavities used as sleeping-places.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Briefly and imperfectly, that is the interior of
the Pecht's house.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Viewed from the outside, what does it resemble? The
underground passage of approach is invisible. The "house"
itself "is generally of a conical form, and externally closely
resembles a large bowl-shaped barrow. It consists of a
solid mass of masonry, covered with a layer of turf a foot
or more in thickness, and has a central chamber surrounded
by several smaller cells." Or, as another writer describes it,
"all that meets the eye at first is a green, conical mound
... resting silently amid the moorland solitude." The
entrance to this seeming hillock, situated sometimes at its
base, more frequently, perhaps, at the extremity of a narrow,
underground tunnel, was never very conspicuous, since it was
only about a couple of feet high. In the days when the
Pechts were actually inhabiting these "green hillocks," it is
likely they took the precaution to conceal this outer orifice,
small though it was, as well as possible. Thus, the adventurer
or colonist of another race, arriving at a settlement of
Pechts' houses, saw nothing but one or more grassy, conical
hillocks rising out of the surrounding moor.</p>

<p>Since the Gaelic term <i>broch</i> (for it is Gaelic, though not
exclusively so) is used to denote the one variety of these
"Pictish" dwellings, let us employ, if only temporarily, the
Gaelic term which denotes the other. That kind of <i>broch</i>,
then, which is covered over with earth and turf so as to
resemble a conical green mound, is known in Gaelic by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
name of <i>sith-bhrog</i>, or <i>sith-bhrugh</i>; that is to say, the broch
of the <i>sith</i>. Still more commonly, it is styled a <i>sithean</i>, or
<i>sith</i>-place. When rendered in our modern English spelling,
according to its pronunciation, this distinctive <i>sith</i> becomes
spelt <i>shee</i>; as in the case of <i>Gleann-sith</i>, which is written
"Glenshee." And, similarly, <i>sithean</i> becomes <i>sheean</i>. It is
the "sheean," then, and not the "broch" proper, that is
regarded by such archæologists as Mr. Petrie as peculiarly
the dwelling of the Pechts.</p>

<p>Now, if any Highlander were asked his opinion as to the
former inhabitants of the "sheeans," he would have but one
answer to give. And the nature of that answer is very
clearly shown by those Highlanders who have compiled the
leading Scottish-Gaelic dictionaries. <i>Brog</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, "broch") is
itself defined as an obsolete term for "a house"; but <i>bruth</i>
and other variants connect, if they do not identify, the "broch"
with the "sheean." The various definitions are these: <i>Bruth</i>,
"a house half under the surface," "the dwelling of fairies in
a hill"; <i>sith-bruth</i>, <i>sith-bhrugh</i>, "a fairy hill or mansion";
<i>sith-bhrog</i>, <i>sith-bhruach</i>, <i>sith-bhruth</i>, "a fairy hill," "a fairy
residence," "fairyland"; <i>sithean</i>, "a little hill or knoll," "a
fairy hill"; <i>sithain</i>, "a green knoll or hillock, tenanted,
according to superstitious belief, by fairies."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Thus, the houses of the Pechts or dwarfs were inhabited
by the people known as "fairies." As the fairies were
"little people," there is here no contradiction in terms. We
have, moreover, seen that the same "conical, green mounds"
are remembered in Orkney and Shetland as the homes of
the "trows." "Trow," however, is itself equivalent to <i>droich</i>,
or dwarf. Therefore, the belief that those outward-seeming
"green hillocks" were the abodes of Pechts is quite in
agreement with the traditions that refer to those mound-dwellers
as <i>trows</i> and <i>fairies</i> (otherwise "the little people").
Because <i>pecht</i> (or <i>pech</i>), <i>trow</i>, and <i>fairy</i> are all synonyms
for "dwarf."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>In a reference to the popular traditions of Northumberland,
the Picts are spoken of as "a race of people who are represented,
in such legends, as endowed with supernatural
power, and holding, in the scale of beings, an intermediate
rank between men and fairies."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Sir Walter Scott also
corroborates this belief as existent in Northumberland
("Rob Roy," ch. xxiii). And the writer previously quoted,
in describing the local tradition with regard to the building
of the tower at Abernethy by the Pechts, explains that
"the people always, when they speak of these Peghs,
associate that idea with a notion that they were a preternatural
sort of beings, such as fairies and brownies." Therefore,
without entering into any discussion as to what is or
was meant by "supernatural power," we have ascertained
from these extracts that the Pechts were regarded, in Northumberland
and in Scotland, as a race of people possessing
or claiming "supernatural" attributes. And that they were
akin to "fairies and brownies," if they were not identical
with them. This also is the position of the "Feens" of
Gaelic folk-lore, as the following references will show.</p>

<p>When the celebrated Irish king, Brian Borumha, defeated
the Danes of Dublin and their allies, in the year 1000 A.D.,
it is stated that he appropriated all the vast treasures that
the Danes had gathered together:&mdash;"gold and silver, and
bronze, and precious stones, and carbuncle-gems, and buffalo-horns,
and beautiful goblets," as well as "various vestures of
all colours."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> And the chronicler explains that "never was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
there a fortress, or a fastness, or a mound, or a church, or a
sacred place, or a sanctuary," which the Danes had not
plundered when it fell to their arms. The first three terms,
which in the Gaelic are <i>dún</i>, <i>daingean</i>, and <i>diongna</i>, are
closely allied, and each designates something akin to the
"hollow mounds" of which we have been speaking.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> But
the succeeding sentence is quite explicit: "Neither was there
in concealment under ground in Erinn, <i>nor in the various
solitudes belonging to Fians or to fairies</i>, anything that was
not discovered by these foreign, wonderful Denmarkians,
through paganism and idol worship." With regard to which
last allusion, Dr. Todd says: "The meaning is, that notwithstanding
the potent spells employed by the Fians and
fairies of old for the concealment of their hidden treasures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the Danes, by their pagan magic and the diabolical power
of their idols, were enabled to find them out."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> (The Gaelic
from which Dr. Todd translates the above sentences is as
follows:&mdash;"Ni raibh imorro <i>dún</i> no <i>daingean</i>, no <i>diongna</i>, no
ceall, no cadhas, no neimedh do gabhadh ris an ngláim
nglifidhigh, nglonnmair, ngnuismhir do bhí ag teaglaim, ocus
ag teaccar na hédala sin, óir ni raibhe ifolach <i>fo thalmain</i> in
Erinn ina fá dhiamhraibh díchealta ag <i>fianaibh</i> no ag
<i>síthcuiraibh</i> ní na fuaratar na Danmargaigh allmardha ingantacha
sin, tre geintlidhecht, ocus tre iodhaladhradh.")<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Like the Pechts in Northumbrian tradition, the Feens
are here not absolutely <i>identified</i> with the fairies, although
the two are so closely associated that it is difficult to distinguish
between the one and the other. The traditions of
the Feens themselves testify to a distinction between the two.
Thus, in the "Dan an Fhir Shicair," or Ballad of the Fairy
Man,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Fin and his six nobles, while walking out one evening,
see a fairy-man coming towards them, who announces that
he comes from the neighbouring Golden Doon (<i>Dún an oir</i>),
and that his purpose is to cause those Feens to come, by
enchantment, to dine that day with him and his people in
their "hill." Here, then, we have the Feens associating, to
some extent (though not, as it appears, on a very friendly
footing) with fairies, and yet not themselves regarded as
identical with that people.</p>

<p>From the foregoing reference to the plunder of the Danes
at Dublin, in the year 1000, it is evident that "the Feens
and Fairies" were understood, in the traditional history of
the Gaels, to be then actually inhabiting those underground
and half-underground dwellings known as "Pechts' houses."
There is another reference, in the same history, that corroborates
this belief. The date when Brian Borumha became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
possessor of those "fairy-hoards," which the Danes had
previously obtained by their well-known process of "how-breaking,"<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
was the close of the tenth century. Now, a son
of this same Brian, and also one of his father's chief warriors,
are both described as asserting (on a certain occasion, in the
reign of the same Brian)<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> that they had been tempted by
the fairies to forsake their ancestral cause. "Often," says
Murchadh, "was I offered, in hills and in fairy mansions
[<i>i sithaib ocus i sithbrugaib</i>], this world and these gifts; but
I never abandoned for one night my country nor my inheritance
for them." As Murchadh's response was evoked by a
similar statement on the part of Dunlang, it thus appears
that, in rifling the abodes of the "how-folk," the Danes were
robbing a race <i>then alive</i>, and were not merely appropriating
unclaimed treasure. And, indeed, the Scandinavian
accounts of "how-breaking" distinctly point out that this
pastime involved a struggle of life and death with the armed
inmate of the "how."</p>

<p>The evidence of Murchadh and Dunlang, then, shows that
intercourse with "the fairies" was not a matter for wonder;
and, moreover, that, for one reason or another, the latter
desired to seduce the Gaelic-speaking people from their
allegiance. That they were eventually successful with Dunlang
seems pointed out by the statement, made elsewhere,
that this Dunlang was himself a fairy (<i>sioguidhe</i>).<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> And it is
well known that "Fairies," as well as "Feens," while possessing
distinct innate attributes, were not averse to obtaining
adherents from other races, who thus became "Feens" and
"Fairies" by adoption.</p>

<p>In the instance of Murchadh and Dunlang, however, the
<i>Feens</i> are not named; and it is a matter for conjecture
whether they ought to be included among the Fairies there
spoken of. But, at any rate, the incident shows that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Fairies (if not the Feens) formed an active, existent caste or
race, subsequent to the date of Brian's famous victory over
the Danes; and that the Danish inroads on their doons,
brochs, hows, etc., in the neighbourhood of Dublin had not
by any means annihilated them as a people.</p>

<p>Of this robbery of the "how-folk" by the Danes in the
Dublin district, something further may be said in passing.
The date of these raids is stated to have been 861 or 862 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>,
when the Danes overran the whole district of the Boyne
and Blackwater (co. Meath), and broke into the "fairy hills"
of that region; one of which, that of New Grange, is
probably the most interesting example of its class that is at
present known to archæologists.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Therefore, the booty which
the Danes thus obtained in 862 must have formed a portion
of that captured by King Brian, after his victory, in the
year 1000. And it is clear enough that it was this special
treasure that the chronicler referred to when he spoke of the
hoards which the Danes sought out and discovered "in concealment
under ground" and "in the various solitudes (or
secret places) belonging to Feens or to Fairies."</p>

<p>Ought "Fairies," then, to be identified with the "Feens"
and "Pechts" of history and tradition? We have already
seen that, both in Scotland and in Northumberland, the
Pechts are classed with the Fairies in the popular memory.
And from the brief references just made, one would be
disposed at the first glance to say that the two names
applied to one people. But all the people who form the
subject of consideration in these pages belong, even in their
most modern and most modified phases, to the past; and in
looking down that long vista one is often deceived by the
"foreshortening" effects of distance, which seems to unite
what is really distinct and separate. Still, it is evident that
"Fairies" have so many points in common with "Feens"
and "Pechts" that they must all, at least, be classed
together.</p>

<p>The Ayrshire term <i>Fane</i>, which, according to Dr.
Jamieson,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
signifies "a fairy," offers itself as very probably a
variant of the Gaelic <i>Fian</i> (pl. <i>Feinne</i>). But Brittany affords
even a better instance. There, we are told, the peasantry
have memories of a race of <i>Fions</i>, who were dwarfs in stature,
and are described as "living with the fairies."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> And
although we have endeavoured, as far as possible, to restrict
these remarks to the British Islands, and even to a few
special districts, yet the folk-lore of Brittany coincides so
closely with that of the districts just referred to, and is so
corroborative of the theories here stated, that it may be permissible
to quote a few of the Breton beliefs bearing upon
this subject.</p>

<p>Of those whom he states are called the <i>Christian</i> fairies of
Brittany, M. Paul Sébillot gives several particulars.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> These
so-called "Christian" fairies were, he says, "neither wholly
Christian nor wholly pagan," and in the traditions relating
to them he dimly recognizes their possible identification
with the heathen priestesses<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> of Brittany, at the time when
they were gradually becoming converted to Christianity.
They are celebrated, like the Pechts of Scotland, as the
builders of churches. And just as local tradition states
that the Pechts who built the Round Tower of Abernethy,
in the manner already described, accomplished their work
in the course of a single night, so a certain chapel in
the Côtes-du-Nord is said to have been built in one
night by the "fairies." Moreover, in two of the instances
referred to by M. Sébillot, the top stone of the building
is or was lacking, for the reason that the daylight had
surprised the builders at their work.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Now, this is precisely
what is stated of the Pictish builders of the Round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Tower at Abernethy, who are said to have been much
irritated because an early riser in the village discovered
them at work, and thus deprived the building and its
builders of their claim to a "supernatural" origin.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Further,
these Breton "fairies" are spoken of as carrying
the stones in their aprons, like the Picts of Northumberland,
the castle-building "genii" of Yorkshire, and the
"witch" who helped to build the Forfarshire fort of Cater
Thun.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> And, as in the two latter instances, as well as in
several of the others referred to, the stones were carried
from "a great distance" by the Breton fairies, on at least
one occasion.</p>

<p>To this Breton comparison one is tempted to add that of
the Netherlands. In referring to the dwarfs who once inhabited
the neighbourhood of Tienen, M. Pol de Mont states
that "they were uncommonly small of stature, but of extraordinarily
great strength"<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>; a statement which is paralleled
by "the vulgar account" in Scotland, "that the Pechs were
unco wee bodies, but terrible strang." And, in the Journal
of Folk-lore just quoted from, the same kind of people are
again suggested by the <i>Gypnissen</i>; "queer little women,"
who lived in a "castle" which had been reared in a single
night, and who, like the Scotch "brownies" (with whom the
Pechts are classed by the Scotch), were content to perform
such everyday drudgery as washing the clothes of the taller
race living near them, for no higher remuneration than their
daily food.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The "castle" in which they dwelt is not spoken
of as visible at the present day, but the probability is that
it was of the same nature as the <i>Aschberg</i>, near Casterlé,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
which M. Pol de Mont states<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> is declared by tradition to be
a chambered mound, capable of housing as many as fifty
<i>bergmannetjes</i>, or mound-dwarfs (the Dutch term being
equivalent to the Scotch "how-folk" or the English "hill-men").</p>

<p>Nor can one omit the following testimony from the island
of Sylt, off the Schleswig coast, supplied by Mr. William
George Black. Referring to a story of "Finn, the king of
the dwarfs," Mr. Black explains as follows:&mdash;"These were
an odd, small, tricky, people whom the Frisians found in Sylt
when they took possession. They lived underground, wore
red caps, and lived on berries and mussels, fish and birds,
and wild eggs. They had stone axes and knives, and made
pots of clay. They sang and danced by moonlight on the
mounds of the plain which were their homes, worked little,
were deceitful, and loved to steal children and pretty women:
the children they exchanged for their own, the women they
kept. Those who lived in the bushes, and later in the Frieslanders'
own houses, like our own brownies, were called
'Pucks,' and a sandy dell near Braderup is still known as the
Pukthal.... They had a language of their own,
which lingers yet in proverbs and children's games. The
story of King Finn's subjects is evidently one of those
valuable legends which illuminate dark pages of history. It
clearly bears testimony to the same small race having inhabited
Friesland in times which we trace in the caves of the
Neolithic age, and of which the Esquimaux are the only
survivors." Mr. Black has himself visited one of those
"green mounds" which are said to have been inhabited by
this Sylt "Finn," and he states that when it was first
scientifically examined, in 1868, it was found to contain
"remains of a fireplace, bones of a small man, some clay
urns, and stone weapons."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>These Continental instances may be regarded as relating
rather to the "Feens of Lochlin" than to those of Ireland
and Great Britain. But one thing quite evident from the
foregoing references is that the "Fians and Fairies" of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Ireland, the "Fions, or Feins, and Fairies" of Brittany, and
the similar people in the Netherlands and in Friesland, were
all nearly identical, if they were not quite identical, with
the "preternatural sort of beings" known to Scotch folk-lore
as Pechs, or Pechts, or Piks, and to history in general
as Picts.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>The Gaelic accounts do not, of course, refer to the "Fairies"
under that name. It is therefore unnecessary to add anything
here to the many attempted solutions of the etymology
of "Fairy." But the Gaelic records speak of these people
as the <i>Fir Sithe</i>, or <i>Daoine Sithe</i>&mdash;the <i>Sithe</i>-folk. As already
pointed out, this word is pronounced as if spelt <i>Shee</i> or <i>Sheey&#0277;</i>].
It is also written <i>Sidhe</i>, and this brings us to the older spelling
before the dental had been aspirated out of existence.
The older form of the word is <i>Side</i>, presumably pronounced
as <i>Sheed&#0277;</i>. What are the conclusions arrived at with regard
to these <i>Fir Sidhe</i>?</p>

<p>"We know now," says a recent writer, already quoted, "that
the Sidhe were early peoples and their gods, incorporated
into the following races.... We find under the Arctic
Circle, and among the Finns and other 'Altaic' or Turanian
tribes of Russia, the same belief in 'Tshuds' or vanished
supernatural inhabitants of the land, pointing to the same
mixture of ideas we find in Ireland concerning dispossessed
peoples of a different tongue but high civilisation, whose
record remains only in legend. The 'Shee' of Ireland is the
same word we find in Asia, but softened down in pronunciation.
Among the early Russians and Irish we can safely
infer the Turanian underfolk with its myths and manners of
life, its subterranean dwellings and repute as magicians; in
both we perceive remarkably clever members of the Finno-Ugrian
women-folk gaining a power over chiefs of the conquering
hordes, and going down into legend as supernatural
Sidhes or Tshuds."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> According to this writer, then, the
"Fairies," whose treasures were seized by the Danes of
Dublin in the ninth century, belonged to the Turanian or
Finno-Ugrian race of the Tshuds. And the traditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
current in Ireland and Scotland regarding the <i>Fir Sidhe</i>, are
counterparts of those current in the north of Europe with
regard to the <i>Tshuds</i>. It does not certainly tend to the simplification
of a very complex question to discover that the
North Europeans, who remember so much about those
<i>Tshuds</i>, are the very people who, of all modern Europeans,
seem to have most resemblance to the <i>Fir Sidhe</i>. In reviewing
a recent collection of Lapp folk-tales, Mr. Ralston states
that "the traditions relating to the constant struggle maintained
between the Lapp aborigines and their foreign
enemies" forms an important portion of the collection.
"The first nine stories all refer to the foes known as
<i>Tsjuderne</i>, the <i>Tsjuder</i>&mdash;the Chudic Finns of the Baltic and
other coasts. When these dreaded enemies appeared, the
Lapps would take refuge in their underground retreats."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
Thus, in accepting Tshud as identical with <i>Side</i> or <i>Sidhe</i>, we
have to recognize that the people so <i>named</i> were the bitter
foes of the very race that most resembles them&mdash;the "underground"
folk of Lapland. Perhaps the explanation of this
apparent contradiction is, that the fact of antagonism existing
between two nations is no proof of any great racial
difference between them.</p>

<p>Whether the word "Tshud" is, or is not, a variant of <i>Sidhe</i>,
there seems good reason for believing that such a variant
ought to be recognized in the <i>seid</i> of the Sagas. We are told
by Thorpe that witchcraft was <i>seidhr</i>, which word some
derive from <i>siodha</i> (modern <i>seethe</i>), to boil. "Boiling 'seid,'
or the witches' broth, was the chief art in witchcraft," says
Mr. Du Chaillu; who adds that "the witchcraft songs which
were used for the seid" were called <i>Vard-lokur</i>,&mdash;"weird or
fate songs." The "seid" platform and the rites performed
on and around it are described at the same place (<i>Viking
Age</i>, ii., 394-398:&mdash;"<i>Seid</i> was to be performed. A <i>Seid-hjall</i>,
or platform consisting of a flat stone, was laid upon
three or four posts, and women were to be found who knew
how to recite or sing the so-called Vardlokur. When all this
was ready, and the <i>Volva</i> [sibyl] on the platform, the women
formed in a circle round it, and the effective song was chanted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
while the seeress, with the strangest gesticulations, made
her conjurations and received her revelations." "Once at a
feast, according to ancient custom, Ingjald prepared incantation
(<i>seid</i>), that men might know their fates. There was a
Finn woman skilled in witchcraft.... The Finn woman
was placed high, and splendid preparations made for her;
each of the men went from his seat to inquire of her about
their fates."</p>

<p>Similar accounts are given by Thorpe, who states that it,
<i>seid</i>, "was regarded as unseemly for men, and was usually
practised by women only: we nevertheless meet with seid-men."
And again:&mdash;"On account of its wickedness, it was
held unworthy of a man to practise seid, and the seid-man
was prosecuted and burned as an atrocious trollman.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The
seid-women received money to make men hard, so that iron
could not wound them." "The most remarkable class of
seid-women were the so-called Valas, or Völvas. We find
them present at the birth of children, when they seem to
represent the Norns." "That the Norns, who appeared at
the birth of children, were of the race of the dwarfs," is elsewhere
suggested by Mr. Thorpe.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Scott, also (<i>The Pirate</i>, Note R), quotes from Kaspar
Bartholin a long account of one of those "Valas," as given
in the <i>Saga of Eric Rauda</i>. From which it is seen that,
according to the custom described by Thorpe and Du Chaillu,
she stood "on a sort of elevated stage," when delivering her
prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Scott adds that Bartholin "mentions similar
instances" to that of "the little Vala" (as this one was
called), "particularly of one Heida, celebrated for her predictions,"
who attended festivals for the purpose of telling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
fortunes, accompanied by "thirty male and fifteen female
attendants."</p>

<p>In all these accounts we see the fairies of tradition, notably
the "fairy godmother" who came to the birth or christening
of children. The man who practised <i>seid</i> rendered himself
liable to be prosecuted and burned as a <i>trow</i>, "an atrocious
trollman;" or, in the Gaelic, a <i>fear-side</i>. If the words
"seid" and "side" are not practically one, it is at least evident
that they relate to the very same people. And the
<i>bean-side</i> (banshee) of Gaelic tradition is simply the seid-woman,
remembered chiefly in her less pleasing aspect, as
the foreboder of death or misfortune.</p>

<p>Thus, whether <i>side</i> ought to be held as primarily denoting
the incantations, or the enchanters themselves, it is this
worship that is indicated in the metrical life of St. Patrick,
which says of him (Skene's "Celt. Scot.," II. 108):&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
"He preached threescore years<br />
The Cross of Christ to the <i>Tuatha</i> [people] of Feni.<br />
On the <i>Tuatha</i> of Erin there was darkness.<br />
The <i>Tuatha</i> adored the <i>Side</i>."<br />
</div>

<p>Nor is there anything inconsistent with these deductions
in the appearance of a <i>Finn</i> woman as a celebrated <i>seid</i>-woman.
For, in Shetland, the Finns are even yet "reckoned
among the Trows."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>To return, however, to the <i>Sidhe</i> people of the British
Islands. The Blackwater valley of Leinster, whose "fairy"
strongholds and abodes were entered and plundered by the
ninth-century Danes, reminds one by its name that the
Blackwater valley of Munster is also famous for its fairy
associations. In one of Mr. William Black's novels
("Shandon Bells") there are frequent references to a chief of
the Fir Sidhe named <i>Fierna</i>,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> who is remembered as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
leader of the "little people" of the south-west. His chief
residence appears to have been a certain <i>Knockfierin</i>, or
Fierna's Hillock, which has perhaps been investigated by
local archæologists. Several of the Limerick traditions
relating to Fierna have been contributed by Mr. David
Fitzgerald to the "Revue des Traditions populaires" (April
1889), and one of these tells how a mysterious stranger
one night aroused a poor cripple and gave him a letter
to take to Fierna. The messenger entered the fairy "hill,"
where he saw the chief&mdash;an old, white-bearded man. On
reading the letter, Fierna declared it to be a challenge
of battle on the part of the "King of the Sidhfir of the
North"; a challenge which Fierna was loath to accept,
because, as he explains, "my people of Munster are the
weaker party."</p>

<p>This legend, then, shows the Fir Sidhe (or Sidhfir) as a
people not always friendly to each other, although of kindred
race. Moreover, it suggests that those of Ireland were
divided into at least two sections&mdash;the Sidhfir of Munster
and those of "the North." When we remember that in the
ninth century "Feens and Fairies" were equally regarded as
owners of the "underground" dwellings which were then
plundered (and which still remain), it is noteworthy that in
this very detail we have another parallel between the two
castes&mdash;if they were two. For the Feens of Ireland were
also divided into sections, and it may be remembered that
two of these&mdash;"the Feens of Leinster and the east of Ulster,"
and those of "Connaught and the west of Ireland," were
referred to on a previous page as engaged in building a famous
hill-fort for their great leader, Fin. If the "Sidhfir of the
North" were not the same as the Feens of Leinster and the
east of Ulster, they occupied much of the same ground, and
had so many points in common, that it is difficult to say
wherein they differed.</p>

<p>Nor is this deduction at variance with the belief that the
people just named were one with the Pechts of history. For
the <i>Cruithné</i> of Ulster formed a distinct division of the
Pechts; and, indeed, to be still more specific, were latterly
associated with the <i>eastern</i> part of that province. And, as
for internecine warfare, that forms no obstacle to the identification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of the historical Pechts, in their later stages, with the
<i>Sidhfir</i> of popular legend.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Like the rivers of the same name in Leinster and Munster,
there is a Blackwater in Perthshire which has fairy traditions,
and, in consequence, the valley through which it flows is
known as Glenshee (<i>Gleann-sith</i>). It is also remembered as
a favourite hunting-ground of the Feens. Here they used to
come, says an ancient poem,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> to chase the deer and elk. The
stories of Fin and his Feens are full of references to their
hunting exploits. And an old poem<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> recites how, even while
Ireland was chiefly peopled and ruled by another race, the
ancient rights of the Feens, in this as in other respects, were
still duly acknowledged. Fin, we are told,</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"possessed the old rights</span><br />
Which previously were his.<br />
From Hallowmass on to Beltin,<br />
His <i>Feens</i> had all the rights.<br />
The hunting without molestation,<br />
Was theirs in all the forests."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The "rights" possessed by these people between All
Hallow-tide and Beltin, or from the first of November to the
first of May, were, according to Keating,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> that they were
quartered upon the country-people, who had to support them
during all that period. But from the first of May on to the
first of November, the Feens were obliged to support themselves,
which they did by hunting and fishing. It was during
this latter period, therefore, that "the hunting without
molestation was theirs in all the forests." Perhaps the expression
"<i>all</i> the forests" is too comprehensive. Mr. J. F.
Campbell, in referring to the Feens,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> speaks of their "maintaining
themselves by hunting deer, extensive tracts of land
being allotted to them for that purpose." Perhaps, also, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
word "forest" ought to be understood much in the way that
"deer forest" now is.</p>

<p>"It was said at that time," says a West Highland tale,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
"that Ireland was a better hunting-ground than the Scotch
Highlands; that there were many great beamed deer in it,
rather than in the Highlands. It was this which used to
cause the Feens to be so often in Ireland." Nevertheless, the
poem by Allan MacRuaridh, already referred to, states that
the Perthshire Glenshee (or rather, the more important of the
two Perthshire glens so named) was famous as a hunting-ground
of the Feens, for the reason that it abounded in "deer
and elk." Whether the "elk" of the one writer, and the
"great antlered deer" of the other represent the same
animal, or two separate species now extinct in these islands,
is uncertain. In the account contributed to the (Old) Statistical
Account of Scotland, the minister of the parish of Clunie,
Perthshire, which is not very far from Glenshee, remarks
(ix. 256-7, <i>note</i>): "The head of the urus has been dug up in
this neighbourhood, as also the palmated horns of the elk,
together with the horns and skeletons of large deer, supposed
to be the moose-deer."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> One of the tales of the Feens, which
is common from County Mayo to Sutherlandshire, says Mr.
J. F. Campbell, has reference to the hunting of an animal
called the <i>lon-dubh</i>, which word Mr. Campbell, on the suggestion
of his collector (Mr. MacLean), believes ought to be
translated "black elk." This "black elk," then, which the
Feens used to hunt, was an animal of much greater size than
the deer, on the testimony of these tales, told in the degenerate
days when the "black elk" and its hunters had
become only a memory. "These [tales] <i>may</i> date from the
days when men hunted elks in Erin, as they now do in
Scandinavia," says Mr. Campbell.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> It is to be remembered,
however, that at the battle of Gawra, and, indeed, long after
that date, the Feens of Scandinavia were in association with
those of Ireland and of Scotland; and traditions relating to
animals long extinct in Britain might really refer to incidents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
in Scandinavia, within comparatively modern times. But, on
the other hand, there is the visible testimony of the "palmated
horns of the elk, together with the horns and skeletons of large
deer, supposed to be the moose-deer," dug up in the very
neighbourhood which is famous as a favourite hunting-ground
of the Feens, where they came "to chase the deer and elk."
The inference is, then, that either the tales which relate to
that time are very old, or else that the animals referred to
did not become extinct in these localities at a very remote
date.</p>

<p>And the latter inference is, in point of fact, the right one;
if we do not restrict <i>lon-dubh</i> to the precise meaning of
"black elk." Mr. J. F. Campbell not only tells us that
certain "great antlered deer" were formerly hunted by the
Feens, but he also points out Sutherlandshire traditions which
tell how witches and fairies used to <i>milk</i> the female deer.
And this statement forms one of the reasons which lead him
to believe that Fairies, Picts, and Lapps were practically one
people; for his deduction therefrom is this:&mdash;"Fairies, then,
milked deer, as Lapps do." Now, the point of this is that
the deer milked by the Lapps is the <i>reindeer</i>, and not any
variety of deer now existing in the British Islands. Mr.
Campbell's further reference to "a story published by Grant
Stewart, in which a ghost uses a herd of deer to carry her
furniture," quite bears out his belief that the reindeer was
domesticated, as well as hunted, by the little people. And
it is an actual historical fact that the reindeer was hunted in
Caithness so recently as the twelfth century. In a very full
and exhaustive "Notice of Remains of the Rein-Deer,
<i>Cervus tarandus</i>, found in Ross-shire, Sutherland, and Caithness,"<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
the late Dr. John A. Smith, Sec. S. A., Scot., has
pointed out that the seventeenth-century historian, Torfæus,
mentions that it was the custom of two earls of Orkney,
during the twelfth century, to cross over to Caithness from
the Orkneys, for the purpose of hunting the roe-deer <i>and the
reindeer</i>. Dr. Smith adds that the correctness of Torfæus'
statement having been at one time called in question, the
matter was placed beyond all doubt by a reference to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
work of a learned annotator and editor of Torfæus (of the
year 1780), who shows that the original manuscript whence
Torfæus derived his information uses the words "rauddýri edr
<i>hreína</i>" to denote those roes and reindeer of Caithness. Indeed,
Dr. Smith's paper affords plenty of confirmation of
this historical statement, since it is chiefly devoted to a consideration
of the reindeer's horns found in various parts of
the north of Scotland; some of them in those very "brochs"
which are so associated with "the little people." And as,
even at the present day, the higher mountains of Scotland
abound in reindeer-lichen, there is nothing in the natural
condition of the place to contradict the assertion of the historian.
Therefore, Mr. Campbell's hypothesis that the fairy
"herds of Glen Odhar" were herds of reindeer, receives every
confirmation from history, tradition, and fact. And, thus, the
figure of the reindeer incised on the monumental stone near
Grantown, in the same quarter of Scotland (of which a
representation is given on page 122 of Dr. Anderson's
"Scotland in Early Christian Times"), may have been
"drawn from life" at that very place, and need not be any
older than the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>"Hunting appears all along to have been a favourite
amusement of the <i>Seelie Court</i>," says a writer on the fairies
of Clydesdale,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> "and innumerable are the stories which are
told concerning the magnificence and splendour of the royal
retinue." There is also a Highland tale<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> which describes how
the dwarfs used to be seen "hunting on the sides of Ben
Muich Dhui, dressed in green, and with silver-mounted bridles
to their horses which jingled as they rode." And a writer of
the seventeenth century<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> tells "how there was a King and
Queen of Pharie, of such a Court, and train, as they had, and
how they had the teind [tithe] and dutie, as it were, of all
corn, flesh, and meale, how they rode and went alongs the
sides of hills, all in Green apparel." That green was the
special colour of the fairies, everybody knows. And that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
was also the colour of the Feens is what certain sections of
the people of modern Ireland do not allow one to forget.</p>

<p>Thus, in regarding these people as hunters, any distinction
between "Feens and Fairies" seems to vanish altogether.
Although it does not appear to be stated in so many words
that the Feens "had the tithe and dutie, as it were, of all
corns, flesh, and meale," yet the same fact is practically stated
when we are told that, during the six months of autumn and
winter, the Feens were kept in idleness by the people of the
country ("billeted upon the country," as Keating has it), and
this as a matter of right. The very dates upon which this
period began and ended&mdash;Hallow-E'en and Walpurgis-night&mdash;are
pregnant with "fairy" associations. And when the
green-clad Feens, typified by their dwarf chief, had the exclusive
right of hunting, during the spring and summer
months, up till the end of October, over "extensive tracts of
land allotted to them for that purpose," they could not have
greatly differed from those little people who are even yet
remembered as "hunting on the sides of Ben Muich Dhui,
dressed in green." And it was distinctly understood that
this right was theirs "without molestation." There is a real
matter-of-fact meaning in the ballad, placed in the mouths
of people of a taller race, and relating to that period and
those privileged hunters&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>
"Up the airy mountain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down the rocky glen,</span><br />
We daren't go a-hunting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For fear of little men."</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Of which the historical interpretation, as applied to Scotland,
apparently is, that these popular traditions relate to the time
when the Pechts, conquered by the Scots, who subsequently
were reinforced by various later immigrant races, still retained
a certain amount of independence, with special rights in certain
districts, reserved to them as "Pecht lands." Their
dwarfish stature is seen from the very word by which they
are known, as well as from the dwellings they inhabited.
Their small horses are spoken of in the earliest accounts of
them,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and indeed still survive, though no doubt in blended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
forms, as the small breeds of Galloway, Shetland, and various
parts of England. Their favourite colour gave them, in their
earliest days, the title of Green Men or <i>Virides</i>; although
then the colouring was applied in a more primitive fashion.</p>

<p>Apart from all the resemblances specially referred to, there
is a general association in the popular mind between Pechts
and Fairies. Both are regarded as extinct races, and the
date of their disappearance, though vague, points to the one
period; and localities known as the abodes of Pechts are also
known as the abodes of Fairies. For example, an antiquary
of that neighbourhood (Sir Herbert Maxwell) states that
"the fortified promontory of the Mull [of Galloway] is
locally believed to have been the last stronghold to which the
Picts of Galloway retired before an overwhelming force of
Scotic (?) invaders." In the same paper,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and referring to the
same promontory, the writer specifies "a small fortification
called the 'Dunnan,' credited with having been a favourite
haunt of the fairies." Again, the famous Pictish hill-fort in
Forfarshire, known as the "White Cater Thun," is equally
famous as a fairy stronghold. This celebrated fortress has
been described on a previous page. It crowns a hill in the
neighbourhood of the ancient city of Brechin, the centre of a
district which was indisputably a territory of the Pechts.
Even yet one may discern in the ruins of this fort the traces
of the dwellings which so closely characterize the architecture
of the Pechts, the chambers made within the thickness
of the wall. Within the long elliptical enclosure of the
White Cater Thun there are, indeed, faint traces of other
buildings; but the great majority of its garrison must have
been housed, after the fashion of the race, in the chambers
that are traceable all along the actual rampart itself. And
of this chambered fortress local tradition states that it was
"the abode of fairies, and that a brawny witch carried the
whole [of the stones] one morning from the channel of the
West Water [a neighbouring river] to the summit of the hill,
and would have increased the quantity ... but for the
ominous circumstance of her apron-string breaking, while
carrying one of the largest! This stone was allowed to lie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
where it fell, and is pointed out to this day on the north-east
slope of the mountain! This tradition, it may be remarked,"
continues our authority,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> "however <i>outré</i>, is curious from its
analogy to that concerning the castles of Mulgrave and
Pickering in Yorkshire, the extensive causeways of which are
said to have been paved by genii named Wada and his wife
Bell, the latter, like the Amazonian builder of Caterthun,
having carried the stones from a great distance in her
apron!" Among all the exaggeration and confusion of these
statements two things are quite discernible&mdash;the identity of
Pechts with fairies or other "supernaturals" in general&mdash;and
(in particular) the identity of the descriptions given of
people so denominated, in the region of Caterthun and of
Yorkshire, and the descriptions of the Northumbrian Pechts
as quoted on a previous page.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Indeed, the accounts given of
the Pechts in the locality last-named, as well as some features
of the traditional builders of Abernethy Round Tower, render
it impossible to distinguish, in these two cases, between
"Pechts" and "Fairies," or "Witches." And this, indeed,
as we have seen, was the popular belief.</p>

<p>The conclusion, therefore, to be drawn from what has been
said upon this subject is that, although the term <i>Pict</i> or <i>Pecht</i>
has been chosen by History as that by which a certain race
of people, once found in Scotland, ought to be remembered,
yet that term indicates nothing more<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> than <i>Trow</i> or <i>Dwarf</i>,
either of which names might as reasonably have been chosen
as their synonym <i>Pecht</i>. And that when one speaks of
<i>Pechts</i>, <i>Trows</i>, or <i>Dwarfs</i>, one is speaking of the same kind
of people&mdash;the mound-dwellers, or "underground" races of
the past. Further, that the people traditionally remembered
in Shetland as <i>Finns</i> belonged to that group; as also those
whom Gaelic folk-lore styles the <i>Feinne</i>. And that, along with
many other popular terms not here enumerated, one of the
names by which such people have been widely known is that
of "the Fairies."</p>

<p>There is one variety of the underground dwellings which,
in the northern counties of Scotland if not elsewhere, is
more specially indicated by the term "Earth House," or
"Eirde House." With regard to this class of structure, an
experienced archæologist<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> makes the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The whole of these have been formed after one idea, viz. to secure
an unobserved entrance, and to preserve a curved shape. From the
entrance the first part of these structures is generally a low and narrow
passage, growing in width and height from the point where the direction
is changed, and terminating in a rounded extremity.</p>

<p>"The part of them last referred to is generally from five to nine feet
in width, with a height barely sufficient to permit a man to stand erect.
In some cases, however, they have been found to be of much more contracted
dimensions throughout. The Eirde House at Migvie, in Cromar,
only admits a single person to pass along; while that at Torrich, in
Strathdonan, Sutherlandshire, is barely three feet in width.</p>

<p>"Dr. Mitchell has described another at Erribol, in that county, which
is more like a large drain than anything else.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"These underground houses have occasionally smaller chambers, as
offshoots from the main one, which are entered by openings of small
size.</p>

<p>"They occur at times singly, and at others in groups. On a moor near
Kildrummy, in Aberdeenshire, a group of nearly fifty were discovered.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"It has been doubted if these houses were ever really used as places
of abode, a purpose for which they seem in no degree to be suited.</p>

<p>"But as to this there can be no real doubt. The substances found in
many of them have been the accumulated <i>débris</i> of food used by man,
and indicate his presence as surely as the kindred kitchen-middens which
have recently attracted so much attention, while their occurrence in
groups marks the gregarious habits of the early people. The bones of
the ox, deer, and other like creatures have been found, as well as the
shells of fish, mixed with fatty earth and charred wood. Ornaments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
bronze have been found in a few of them, and beads of streaked glass.
In some cases the articles found would indicate that the occupation of
these houses had come down to comparatively recent times, as in the
case of the Irish crannogs, where objects of the rudest times are found
alongside of those of the seventeenth century."</p></blockquote>

<p>These underground passages or galleries are also known as
Pechts' or Picts' houses; and they unquestionably belong to
the same family as the other structures so denominated. But
they are the rudest and most primitive of all. Between them
and a chambered mound such as Maes-how, in Orkney, the
difference is great; and still greater is the difference between
them and a non-subterranean "broch," such as that of Mousa,
in Shetland. Yet all these are so united by intermediate
forms that it is difficult to say exactly where the one passes
into the other. The nature of the difference may be expressed
etymologically by saying that they are <i>burrows</i>,
<i>barrows</i>, and <i>brochs</i>, or <i>burgs</i>; the "drain"-like Eirde House
belonging to the first class, the chambered mound to the
second, and the above-ground structure, such as that of
Mousa, to the third. The three terms just used are radically
one, as the buildings themselves are. But they represent
different phases of one idea; and the last phase is very much
in advance of the first. Whether the superiority of the one
class of building over the other has been caused by the
gradual advancement of one homogeneous race, during a
long stretch of time, or by the blending of a higher race with
a lower, within a limited period, must be regarded as an open
question.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>But, although that crude form of earth-house which we
have described as a burrow, is included among the Pechts'
houses of Scotland, it differs in several respects from that
variety which has been regarded as the typical "Pecht's
house," namely, the chambered mound, or "hollow hillock."
One of the salient features of the burrow, the "unobserved
entrance," is equally a feature of the hollow mound; and the
latter has also the same narrow, low, subterranean passage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
approach, formed of huge stone slabs. In each, too, as in
the more advanced and elaborate "broch," it is seen that the
builders knew of no other kind of arch than that formed by
the gradual convergence of the walls, by means of each
course overlapping the course immediately below it, until
only a single slab was required to crown the whole by way of
"keystone." The better kind of "burrow," with its "smaller
chambers, as offshoots from the main one," is also closely
akin, in that respect, to the so-called "hollow hill." But,
while having all these points of resemblance, the latter differs
from the former in that its passage dispenses altogether
with the curve which distinguishes the "burrow;" and,
greater difference still, in that it is not merely an underground
dwelling, but that the earth over it is heaped so high
above the level of the adjoining ground that it presents
exactly the appearance of a conical or rounded green hillock,
when looked at from the outside. Moreover, it is only
rendered an "underground" dwelling by the earth-heap imposed
upon the original structure, which itself was built upon
what was then the surface of the ground. Whereas the long,
curved gallery, which has more specially been styled an
"earth-house," is below the surface of the surrounding land,
and is generally discovered by some ploughman whose
plough happens to break or disarrange the stone slabs forming
its roof.</p>

<p>There is no special reason for limiting the term "earth-house"
to the underground gallery just spoken of, because
the chambered mound is also as much an "earth-house."
In either case, the structure itself is of stone. Therefore, we
need not here restrict the term "earth-house" to one of
these two varieties, but apply it equally to both. Each
variety is popularly known as a "Pecht's house," and the one
is as much an "earth-house" as the other.</p>

<p>The "hollow hill," however, will be the variety of earth-dwelling
chiefly considered in this place. But, before leaving
the ruder structure, reference may be made to a Shetland
specimen, examined in 1865. It is described as "of a semicircular
form, two feet or so beneath the arable land, about
thirty feet in length, three feet in breadth and height,
widening out at the western extremity to the form of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
chamber of five feet square; ponderous slabs of mica-slate
form the lintels. These stones have been transported from
Norwick, which is the nearest depôt for such, and distant
two miles." Like other similar structures this was locally
known as a "Fairy Ha'."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Thus, the two varieties of earth-house, each known popularly
as a "Pecht's house," are also both remembered as the
dwelling-place of fairies. For the chambered mound is
equally a "Fairy Knowe"; in Gaelic, a "sheean" (<i>sithean</i>),
or abode of fairies.</p>

<p>And as the "little people" of Scotland have been chiefly
chronicled as "Pechts," or "Picts," we may further consider
them in that twofold character; continuing also to regard
them in the territories which have already been most frequently
named. Of these, none are more worthy of examination
than the districts&mdash;insulated or otherwise&mdash;in the
neighbourhood of the Pecht-land Firth.</p>

<p>"By an authentic record of Thomas, Bishop of the Orkneys,
dated 1443, and published in Wallace's "Orkneys,"
edit. 1700; when the Norwegians conquered these islands
they found them possessed 'by two nations, the Pets [Pehts,
or Pechts] and Papas'"<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> (<i>i.e.</i>, popes or priests). The "popes"
referred to are understood to have been the Irish missionaries
from Iona, and of them there seems to be no distinct
tradition surviving. But the other "nation" is well remembered
in both of the Northern groups. "The first folks that
ever were in our isles were the Picts," says Shetlandic folk-lore;
"they were very small [people]."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>What appears to be a popular tradition relating to the
time when the territory of the mound-dwelling Pechts was
beginning to be invaded and settled by colonists of another
race, is furnished us by Sir Walter Scott. The ballad of
"Alice Brand," in "The Lady of the Lake," speaks of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
"moody Elfin King, who won'd<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> within the hill." And we
are told in the <i>Appendix</i> that this legend "is founded upon
a very curious Danish Ballad, which occurs in the 'Kæmpe
Viser,' a collection of heroic songs first published in 1591."
It begins "<i>Der ligger en vold i Vester Haf</i>," which is rendered
in English, "There lies a wold in Wester Haf."
Scott says:&mdash;"As <i>Wester Haf</i> ... means the <i>West Sea</i>, in
opposition to the Baltic or <i>East Sea</i>, Mr. Jamieson inclines
to be of opinion that the scene ... is laid in one of the
Orkney, or Hebride Islands." Both in this old ballad, and
in Scott's adaptation, there is an element of the magical, or
impossible, or, at least, unexplainable kind; but some of the
leading facts are these:&mdash;A "husband," or yeoman, goes to
this "wold in Wester Haf," taking his wife and all his belongings
with him, and there he proceeds to settle down as a
colonist. Like many other "backwoodsmen," he begins by
felling the trees of the forest<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> for his new home, much to the
indignation of the dwarfs who inhabit a certain "knock"
(Gael. <i>cnoc</i>), or chambered mound, in that district, and who,
indeed, are the owners of the soil.</p>

</div>

<p>However, the husband is not even temporarily bereft of
his wife; and, indeed, after all the threatenings of the "how-folk,"
the settlers are allowed to remain quietly in possession
of their homestead, and their daughter is afterwards married
to the dwarf visitor.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Though this song is from a Danish collection, there is
another of very similar nature in Unst, Shetland. It begins
"Der lived a king into da aste," and it recounts how a certain
"wedded wife" was carried off by "the King o' Ferrie."
Her husband afterwards goes in search of her; and "one
day, in his wandering quest, he sees a company passing along
a hillside, and he recognizes among them his lost lady."
They go into "a great 'ha'-house,' or castle," which is said to
be <i>on</i> the hillside; but as nothing is visible but "a grey
stane," after they have entered, it would seem that <i>the hill
itself</i> was the castle, and the grey stone the entrance door,
as in the case of the Orcadian Maes-how, or many another
residence of the "how-folk." This assumption is quite
borne out by the song itself. The same writer<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> indicates that
such abductions were quite common in Shetland, when she
states that a "witch" who married a dwarf returned once to
her mother's house, and, while imparting to her various other
counsels and warnings, "gave many instructions how to provide
against the enchantments used by Trows for the purpose
of decoying unsuspecting girls into their unhallowed domain."
And her parting injunction was to be sure and have the
maidens "weel cöst about" (? protected by charms) "when
the grey women-stealers are wandering." But instances of
such intercourse between the dwarf races and others, the
abduction being by no means confined to one side, could be
quoted almost interminably.</p>

<p>The celebrated "how" known as Maes-how, in Orkney,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
has just been referred to. It is so admirable a specimen of
the "Pecht's house" proper that no better selection can be
made for a more particular description of such a dwelling.
"It stands about a mile to the north-east of the great stone
ring of Stennis. Its external appearance is that of a truncated
conical mound of earth, about 300 feet in circumference at
the base and thirty-six feet high, surrounded by a trench
forty feet wide. Nothing was known of its internal structure
till the year 1861, when it was opened by Mr. Farrer, M.P.,
but the common tradition of the country represented it as
the abode of a goblin, who was named 'the Hogboy,' though
no one knew why."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> In Lincolnshire, this term "hog-boy"
is pronounced as "shag-boy."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The word pronounced <i>shag</i>
in one place and <i>hog</i> in another, is understood to be the same
as <i>haug</i> or <i>how</i>; and the term is therefore a variant of the
plural "how-folk." It was one of those "shag-boys" or
"hog-boys," then, that local tradition remembered as the
inhabitant of Maes-how. And nowhere is the tenacity of
the popular memory more strongly illustrated than in this
instance. For, during many centuries prior to 1861, this had
been nothing more, to the passing stranger, than a grassy
hillock, utterly void of any indication that its interior was
"hollow," and that the whole structure&mdash;stone-built dwelling,
and super-imposed earth&mdash;was entirely artificial,&mdash;the
work of a vanished race. And yet, so full of vitality is
tradition, that the descendants of those who had seen its
inmate or inmates, knew, in spite of the lapse of a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
years, that this was no ordinary grassy mound, but that once
upon a time it had been the habitation of people of a certain
race, whose characteristics are even yet remembered, if only
in a confused and imperfect manner.</p>

<p>However important and necessary a written description
may be, it is very incomplete without a personal inspection
of the place described, or in lieu of that, the "counterfeit
presentment," which is almost as serviceable. From the
view here given of Maes-how, as it appears from the outside,
and also from the following diagrams, one obtains an
admirable idea of the exterior and interior of a <i>sheean</i>,
Fairy Hillock, or Fairy Ha'.</p>

<p>After examining these pictures of this famous "how," one
is able to fully understand the traditional accounts of the
"hollow hillocks" of the dwarfs. One can fit any of the
many stories that tell of visits paid to such "hills" into this
particular scene. There is the small, concealed entrance at
the base of the hill (at which, or beside which, the visitor
used to knock until "the hill opened"&mdash;revealing a low, narrow, dark passage.</p>

In this instance the aperture is two
feet four inches in height, and of exactly the same breadth;
and its dimensions continue the same for the first twenty-two
and a half feet into the hill (for it will be seen that the
mound of stone and earth that surrounded and covered the
actual building gave the habitation a fictitious base, which
had to be penetrated by this passage until the walls of the
main building were reached&mdash;in the centre of the "hill.")<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>In Maes-how the passage of approach is fully fifty-three feet
long. Its height, as already stated, is only two feet four
inches, during the first twenty-two feet of length; so that
no one, unless an actual dwarf, could walk erect along this
portion. After this the roof of the passage rises to four feet
four inches; and it retains this height during the next twenty-eight
feet of length. The remaining distance&mdash;scarcely
three feet&mdash;is four inches higher; and then the passage
"enters the middle of one of the four sides of a chamber
which is fifteen feet square, and has, when complete, been
about twenty feet high in the centre. The walls of this chamber
are perpendicular for about six feet, after which the slabs,
which generally extend the whole length of a side, project
beyond the courses on which they rest, until in this way the
roof has been completed in the shape of an inverted pyramid
formed of successive steps."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In the three sides of
this central hall (excluding the side at which the long passage
emerges) there are respective entrances into three small
chambers. The largest of these is less than seven feet long,
less than five feet broad, and its roof is only three and a half
feet from the floor.</p>

<p>In assuming that the roof of this building, now open to
the sky, was "completed in the shape of an inverted
pyramid formed of successive steps," Colonel Leslie is at
variance with the description given by an eighteenth-century
writer (in connection with similar buildings), and at variance
also with tradition. The difference is a slight one, but it
ought to be referred to. The roof was not precisely <i>completed</i>
in such buildings, according to the writer referred to;
it "was carried on round about with long stones [each successive
course projecting, and thus gradually narrowing the
orifice], till it ended in an opening at the top, which served
both for light and a vent to carry off the smoke of their
fire." Without this opening the dwelling had very little
light or air; for little of either could have straggled in
from the mouth of the narrow, underground passage, which
reached the open air at a distance of fifty-three feet from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the dwelling, and whose entrance (besides) was nearly always
closed during the day.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>While tradition seems clearly to indicate that the roof of
the dwelling communicated with the open air above, there is
necessarily some uncertainty on this point. The writer who
speaks of the roof of such a building being "carried on round
about with long stones, till it ended in an opening at the
top," may have had in view a structure more resembling
the open air "broch" than the <i>sith-bhrog</i>; although he
mentions that the kind of building he describes often "looks
outwardly like a heap without any design."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> It is undoubted
that many such mounds, for example, those of New Grange
and Dowth, in the Boyne district, have their rude, "Pelasgian
arch," crowned with one large stone as keystone; and that,
therefore, any upward exit from the chamber must have
led off in a slant from some portion of the wall. On the
other hand, there are several indications that when one
ascended the outside of a <i>sheean</i>, in the days when it was
inhabited, one found oneself at the edge of a hollow or
crater, at the foot of which was the narrow orifice that gave
light and air to the chamber below. More than one fairy-hill
of the present day, not yet explored, has a small hole
on its summit, and when a stone is dropped therein, it is
heard to rumble and fall into some unknown cavern below.
And the existence of such "craters" was well known (we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
told by Scott, in his Introduction to the <i>Tale of Tamlane</i>) to
the people of Scotland. "Wells, or pits, on the top of hills
were supposed to lead to the subterranean habitations of the
Fairies." Legendary stories in connection with these there
are many&mdash;of men descending such "pits," sometimes well
knowing what to expect, and of having hand-to-hand fights
with the natives of these abodes. At other times the attack
was made by those "hillmen" themselves; who seem to have
emerged by this entrance as often as by the other. "A
savage issuing from a mount" was once a well-known bearing
in Scottish heraldry. Mr. J. F. Campbell records a Ross-shire
tradition of a dwarf who inhabited <i>Tombuidhe Ghearrloch</i>,
"The Tawny Hillock of Gairloch," and who was the
terror of the neighbourhood (whose chief inhabitants, in his
day, belonged to another race). Before he was himself slain,
this formidable dwarf had killed many of the latter race;
none of whom (with one exception) dared to venture
near his "hillock" after dusk. He was at length killed by
a local champion, still remembered as "Big Hugh" (Uistean
Mor, MacGhille Phadrig;) who was celebrated as a slayer of
dwarfs; and who appears to have devoted himself to their
extermination in that particular district. And in the story
of the killing of this noted dwarf, it is stated that Uistean
climbed to the top of the hillock (<i>Tom-buidhe</i>) and attacked
its inhabitant, who emerged from the foot of its "crater" or
"pit"; in other words, from the roof of his dwelling.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Such a "<i>sheean</i>" is the Denghoog in the Danish island of
Sylt, one of the mounds believed to have been the residence
of Finn, the dwarf king. Mr. W. G. Black, who has visited
this "how," describes it thus:<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Externally merely a swelling green mound, like so many
others in Sylt, entrance is gained by a trap-door in the roof,
and descending a steep ladder, one finds himself in a subterranean
chamber some seventeen by ten feet in size, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
walls of which are twelve huge blocks of Swedish granite;
the height of the roof varies from five feet to six feet. The
original entrance appears to have been a long narrow passage
seventeen feet long and about two feet wide and high. This
mound was examined by a Hamburg professor in 1868, who
found remains of a fire-place, bones of a small man, some
clay urns, and stone weapons."</p>

<p>This example, then, of the abode of one of the "Feens of
Lochlan," corresponds exactly with Maes-how and all similar
"<i>sheeans</i>." And, like them, it is locally remembered as the
residence of a dwarf.</p>

<p>This, of course, is tradition. But the northern sagas (though
"tradition" also) are accepted as "history," in some degree.
And the sagas bear a like record. Their heroes break into
those dwellings, make their entrance by the hole at the
bottom of the "crater," and attack the inhabitants, who,
seizing their weapons, defend their lives and (in many cases)
their treasures. And before leaving the "hollow hill" of
Maes-how, it may be stated that this particular <i>broch</i>, or
<i>sheean</i>, is believed to have been invaded about a thousand
years ago. It was entered in the twelfth century by some of
those North-men who were on their way to the Holy Land;
and these have incised various inscriptions on its inner walls.
But at that date it was empty&mdash;and had been rifled many
centuries before. One legendary tale places the date of its
original despoliation as far back as the year 920; and states
that "Olaf the Norseman" was its invader; and that he encountered
its possessor, whom he overcame&mdash;after a deadly
struggle. And, since "the common tradition of the country
[up to the year 1861, when it was reopened] represented it
as the abode of a goblin, who was named 'the Hog-boy',"
it would seem that the prevailing blood of the country-people
in that district is akin to that of this "Olaf the Norseman;"
and that, therefore, in this instance, the popular memory
reaches back for nearly a thousand years, with the most
perfect precision.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>The Ross-shire <i>Tombuidhe</i>, the Sylt <i>Denghoog</i>; and this
Orcadian <i>broch</i> are all specimens of the one class; and, both
as regards the character of the dwellers and the dwellings,
they have many counterparts. How many we do not yet know.
It is probable that, in the British Islands alone, they may
be numbered by thousands (and we need not here speculate
as to the continent of Europe, and other parts of the globe).
Colonel Forbes Leslie, referring only to Scotland, says that
"even in the present day many a green mound ... is
shunned by sturdy peasants who would not fear the hostility
of any mortal"&mdash;and this because that mound once contained
one or more people of a race of whom that peasant's
ancestors stood greatly in awe. That the valleys of the
Forth and Teith alone contain a great number of those
"green hillocks," as yet unexamined, has been stated by
an eminent investigator of the Scotch <i>brochs</i>, Dr. Joseph
Anderson. How many other districts can tell a similar
story is a problem that will some day be solved.</p>

<p>The collector (who is, to a great extent, the exponent
also) of the "Popular Tales of the West Highlands," appends
several very interesting remarks to one of these stories:
that of "The Smith and the Fairies" (vol. ii. pp. 46-<a href="#Page_55">55</a>).
Among other things he says: "The belief that the 'hill'
opened on a certain night, and that a light shone from the
inside, where little people might be seen dancing, was too
deeply grounded some years ago to be lightly spoken of;
... 'In the glebe of Kilbrandon in Lorn is a hill called
Crocan Corr ... where the fairies ... were often seen
dancing around their fire.'" And reference is also made
to "a certain hill in Muckairn, known to be the residence
of the fairies." The incident connected with it is capped
with a similar one "told of a hill called Ben-cnock in Islay;"
and "another hill, called Cnock-doun" (presumably in Islay),
has a like history. But such "hills" are too numerous to
mention in detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>Owing to the great mass of earth which was heaped over
the dwelling&mdash;the actual "kernel" of the mound&mdash;it will be
seen that new-comers of another race from the mound-dwellers
might build houses, or bury their dead, above the
homes of the "little people," without being aware that the
hill they were so utilizing was entirely of artificial origin.
Nor are there wanting illustrations of this in fact and in
tradition. Legendary lore, indeed, is full of incidents arising
from the contact, often unexpected on the one side, of the
two races; and many such tales reveal the mound-dwellers
in a very homely light. The following story from the Hebridean
island of Barra, for example:</p>

<blockquote><p>"There was a woman in Baile Thangasdail, and she was out seeking
a couple of calves; and the night and lateness caught her, and there
came rain and tempest, and she was seeking shelter. She went to a
knoll with the couple of calves, and she was striking the tether-peg into
it. The knoll opened. She heard a gleegashing as if a pot-hook were
clashing beside a pot. She took wonder, and she stopped striking the
tether-peg. A woman put out her head and all above her middle, and
she said, 'What business hast thou to be troubling this tulman in which
I make my dwelling?' 'I am taking care of this couple of calves, and
I am but weak. Where shall I go with them?' 'Thou shalt go with
them to that breast down yonder. Thou wilt see a tuft of grass. If thy
couple of calves eat that tuft of grass, thou wilt not be a day without
a milk cow as long as thou art alive, because thou hast taken my
counsel.'"<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This story exemplifies the well-known prophetic or "supernatural"
powers of the dwarf races, while at the same time
it presents the "fairy abode" to us in a very matter-of-fact
light. Equally homely and matter-of-fact is this story from
Wigtownshire:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A shepherd's family had just taken possession of a newly-erected
onstead, in a very secluded spot among 'the hills o' Gallowa,' when the
goodwife was, one day, surprised by the entrance of a little woman, who
hurriedly asked for the loan of a 'pickle saut.' This, of course, was
readily granted; but the goodwife was so flurried by the appearance of
'a neibor' in such a lonely place, and at such a very great distance
from all known habitations, that she did not observe when the little
woman withdrew or which way she went. Next day, however, the same
little woman re-entered the cottage, and duly paid the borrowed 'saut.'
This time the goodwife was more alert, and as she turned to replace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
'the saut in the sautkit' she observed 'wi' the tail o' her e'e' that the
little woman moved off towards the door, and then made a sudden 'bolt
out.' Following quickly, the goodwife saw her unceremonious visitor run
down a small declivity towards a tree, which stood at 'the house en'.'
[She passed behind the tree, but did not emerge on the other side, and
the "goodwife," seeing no place of concealment, assumed she was a
fairy.] In a few days her little 'neibor' again returned, and continued
from time to time to make similar visits&mdash;borrowing and lending small
articles, evidently with a view to produce an intimacy; and it was
uniformly remarked that, on retiring, she proceeded straight to the tree,
and then suddenly 'ga'ed out o' sight.' One day, while the goodwife
was at the door, emptying some dirty water into the <i>jaw-hole</i> [sink, or
cess-pool], her now familiar acquaintance came to her and said: 'Goodwife,
ye're really a very obliging bodie! Wad ye be sae good as turn
the lade o' your jaw-hole anither way, as a' your foul water rins directly
in at my door? It stands in the howe there, on the aff side o' that tree,
at the corner o' your house en'.' The mystery was now fully cleared up&mdash;the
little woman was indeed a fairy; and the door of her invisible
habitation, being situated 'on the aff side o' the tree at the house en','
it could easily be conceived how she must there necessarily 'gae out o'
sight' as she entered her sight-eluding portal."</p></blockquote>

<p>This story<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> relates to a district that is noted as being
one of the very latest to retain a population that was
distinctively Pictish, and it unquestionably offers a parallel
to that of the "Gudeman o' Villenshaw," and the "elves
i' the knock that bade." In either case, we have the arrival
of a new-comer of another race, all unconscious that the place
is already inhabited by an earlier, mound-dwelling<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> people.</p>

<p>Of houses built upon the summit or the slope of a fairy hill
a modern instance is furnished by Hugh Miller, in his reminiscences
of Sutherlandshire ("My Schools and Schoolmasters,"
1881 ed., p. 108), wherein he mentions that a
cousin of his had built his house "half-way up the slope of
a beautiful tomhan,"<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> which was regarded as a fairy residence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
This "tomhan" appears to have been near Lairg, and in
"the Barony of Gruids." The neighbouring countryfolk had
expected that "the little people" inside the hill would resent
this intrusion on their privacy, but, of course, nothing of this
kind happened&mdash;as this occurred in the present century,
when the mound-dwelling Pechts lived only in the memory
of those by whose forefathers they had once been greatly
dreaded. But there are various traditional accounts which
point to a time when members of the intruding race, unaware
that the hillock on which they began to build was itself a
building, were obliged to desist by reason of the opposition
of the dwarfs. Thus, a former Grant of Ballindalloch, in
Strathspey, who attempted to build his castle upon a mound,
found every morning that the previous day's work had been
undone, and the stones removed from the site. One night,
while he watched for these disturbers, he heard a voice bid
him to "build on the Cow Haugh," or meadow, which he
accordingly did, without further interruption.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> A similar
account is given in connection with a hill in Aberdeenshire.
"When the workmen were engaged in erecting the ancient
church of Old Deer, in Aberdeenshire, upon a small hill
called Bissau, they were surprised to find that the work was
impeded by supernatural obstacles. At length the Spirit of
the River (says Sir Walter Scott, who tells the story<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>) was
heard to say,&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>
"It is not here, it is not here,<br />
That ye shall build the church of Deer;<br />
But on Taptillery,<br />
Where many a corpse shall lie."<br />
</p></div>

<p>The site of the edifice was accordingly transferred to Taptillery,
an eminence at some distance from the place where
the building had been commenced." In this case the interruption
merely took the shape of a warning, but the midnight
work in the former instance is entirely in keeping
with all that tradition says of the Pechts.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>Hugh Miller again points out a fairy locality, when referring
to a boating excursion on Loch Maree, in 1823, on
which occasion he learned from the boatman that one of
the islands, <i>Eilean Suthainn</i>, was the annual rendezvous of
the fairies, where they paid to their queen the yearly
"kain" or tribute, due to "the Evil One." This reference
is quoted by the author of "Gairloch,"<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> who also states:</p>

<blockquote><p>"In Gairloch we have Cathair Mhor and Cathair Bheag, names
applied to several places; and the Sitheanan Dubha on Isle Ewe and
on the North Point. There is Cathair Mhor at the head of Loch
Maree, and Cathair Bheag (the Gaelic name of the place) at Kerrysdale.
These names mean respectively the big and little seats of the
fairies....</p>

<p>"The name Sitheanan Dubha signifies the black knowes or hillocks
of the fairies. It is applied to two places in Gairloch, viz., to the highest
hill-tops at the north end of Isle Ewe, and to a low hill and small round
loch a full mile due north of Carn Dearg house."</p></blockquote>

<p>Further south than Loch Maree, and situated in the deer-forest
of Mamore, in the Nether Lochaber district, there is
an alleged "hollow hill" which is also exceptionally famous.
It is thus described by a local gillie:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Coming up the Ulnach, sir, you saw a corrie away to the left? Well,
that's Corrie-Vinnean; and the round hillock in the centre, which you
must also have noticed, is a Shiän or fairy-knowe; and in all the <i>garbh-chnochan</i>
(rough-bounds) around us, from Kinloch Leven to Ardverikie,
there is no other shiän so famous as this shiän, and it is the chief palace
of the fairies of all these upland wilds, and it is always occupied by a
company of them. It is never altogether deserted even for a day,
though many other shiäns are sometimes unoccupied for weeks together."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So numerous are the mounds that, owing to the traditions
attaching to them, invite their own destruction at the
hands of the archæologist, that only a limited number of
them can be specified in these pages. Among these were,
until recent years, two "fairy knowes," long known by that
term in the adjoining countryside. They lie between the
rivers Forth and Teith, about four miles to the south of
Doune. One of them was broken into a good many years
ago, and it is now known to antiquaries as the "Broch of
Coldoch" (from the estate on which it is situated).<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> It
appears to be one of those structures which form a connecting
link between the open-air broch, such as that of Mousa,
and the more visible "hill," such as Maes-how. It is circular
in form, has the central chamber and three small chambers
in the thickness of the wall; and the lower portion of a
winding-stair, also in the wall, which shows it to be the
remains of an inferior "Mousa." Its dimensions are like
those of other "brochs," and these are such that, in this case,
they evoked the remark from the writer's guide (a native of
the district) that "it had never been built for men like him."
This, indeed, is the remark that naturally falls from any
visitor to such buildings; as the writer has noticed on several
such occasions (nor can he forget that one, at any rate, of his
companions, in a recent visit to "the hidden places of the
Fians and fairies" in the valley of the Boyne, was debarred
from inspecting these interesting works for the simple reason
that the underground passage of entrance was so strait, in
every way, that for him to worm himself along it, as all
visitors must do, was a physical impossibility). The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
popular belief that such mounds were tenanted by dwarfs
has no stronger testimony than the obvious fact that none
but dwarfs would have thought of raising such structures;
or could have properly utilized them when erected. And
although the most famous of the Boyne mounds just
referred to has been styled "the firm mansion of the
'Dagda'" in ancient records, and, by a modern singer,</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"The Royal Brugh,</span><br />
By the dark-rolling waters of the Boyne,<br />
Where Angus Og magnificently dwells,"<br />
</p></div>

<p>yet such a "mansion" would be a most impracticable kind
of abode for men of the ordinary height of modern Europeans,
if any such felt disposed to imitate the "magnificence"
of Angus Og.</p>

<p>Of this "Royal Brugh" the outward appearance is well
delineated in the engraving which constitutes the <i>Frontispiece</i>.
All that has been said as to the adaptability of Maes-how to
any of the well-known fairy stories is equally applicable to
this Irish "how." The Boyne mound, however, as will be
seen from its measurements, is much larger than the Orkney
one; though the stone structure in its interior is of much the
same dimensions as the other. The interior of the "Broch
of the Boyne," however, represents a much ruder and more
primitive stage in such architecture, and compared with it,
the Orkney "how" is a most finished and elaborate work.</p>

<p>This, then, is what a fairy hill, of the larger class, looks
like to the outsider. And it is clear that, when its entrance
is concealed, as it once was, no stranger, ignorant of such a
thing as a mound-dwelling, would ever think that this
innocent-looking hill was artificially made, and that the
chambers within it were the residence of a family or families.
One might well begin to build, and even to fell trees, upon
the outer "walls" of such a "house," without knowing that
such a proceeding might be resented by "the moody elfin
king that won'd within the hill."</p>

<p>The entrance to this underground hall, which has been rediscovered
for about two centuries, may be discerned almost
at the base of the hill, slightly to the left of the figures of
the man and boy in the foreground. This entrance or doorway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
is represented below, and, like the others of this series,
it is the work of an artist who is also an eminent Irish
archæologist, than whom no one possesses a more intimate
acquaintance with the interior and exterior of the Boyne
mounds. This, then, is an Irish illustration of what the
Shetland boys used to call a "trow's door!"<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p class="caption"> DOORWAY OF THE BRUGH.</p>
</div>


<p>The (not too portly) explorer who enters this doorway and
creeps, sometimes laterally, along the passage, at one point
very low and narrow, works his way at length into the comparatively
large chamber that forms the main part of the
structure. The relation which this passage and chamber
bear to the mound which was heaped over them will be seen
from the transverse sectional view of the "hill," which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
represented in the accompanying plate. The dimensions
and general appearance of this underground gallery and
"hall" will also be fully understood by an examination of
this and the other designs. And one point will be noticed,
namely, that no access to the top of the mound, as in such a
case as Finn's dwelling in Sylt, or the Orkney Maes-how, is
here visible. But it must be borne in mind that, over those
portions of the mound which are represented as solid, the
word "Unexplored" might fitly be written. If this is like
some of the "fairy hills" of tradition, it ought to have a
channel, or passage, leading upward to the summit, and,
indeed, the lower end of such a passage, though at present
choked up, is suggested at one side of the inner chamber
(on the right hand of the explorer), as may be seen in the
plan of the year 1889.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to discriminate between one kind
of "fairy hill" and another. Maeshow and the Sylt Denghoog
appear to closely resemble the modern Lapp <i>gamme</i>,
as regards the upper portion of the structure, for access to
both of these may be gained from the roof. The "trap-door"
to which Mr. Black refers in the Sylt instance appears
to have always existed in one shape or another; and its
original use may be guessed from the following notice of
the same portion of a Lapp <i>gamme</i>. The gamme "is generally
circular, or oblong, having the appearance of a large,
rounded hillock, which indeed it may be termed," says a
Lapland traveller of sixty years ago.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> And he further
states that "an opening in the roof, nearly over the fire-place,
served to let out the smoke; and might be covered at times
with a kind of trap-door, to retain the internal warmth, when
the fire is burnt out. This is always let down at night."
That this was the usage in the dwelling of Finn, or
whatever may have been the name of the Sylt dwarf whose
bones were found in the Denghoog, seems very probable.
But to such chambered mounds as the Broch of the Boyne,
another traditionary egress, whether for the dwellers or for
the smoke, seems more applicable. It has already been
noticed that "pits on the top of hills were supposed to lead
to the subterranean habitations of the Fairies."</p>

</div>

<hr />

<p>But another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
version says that "pits on the tops of mountains are regarded
in the border [<i>i.e.</i>, the Anglo-Scottish Borders] with a degree
of superstitious horror, as the porches or entrances of the
subterraneous habitations of the fairies; from which confused
murmurs, the cries of children, moaning voices, the
ringing of bells, and the sounds of musical instruments are
often supposed to be heard. Round these hills the green
fairy circles are believed to wind in a spiral direction, till
they reach the descent to the central cavern."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Assuming
that "mountains" ought to read "hillocks," and that the
spiral passages are akin to those which wind down the
interior of the walls of such a "broch" as that of Mousa,
this tradition would lead one to believe that the Broch of
the Boyne has a winding passage to the upper air. A recent
visitor has observed that "on the exterior top of the mound
there appears to be a small crater-like depression,"<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> which
he attributes to a subsidence of the structure, but which, on
the other hand, may have always been there. The suggestion
of an upward passage in the interior has just been
referred to. This latter is not indicated at all in the plan of
the year 1724; but as a matter of fact, this detail was not
known until quite recently, when the displacement of a slab
revealed this cavity (as well as some additional spiral
incisions on the slab).</p>

<p>It will be observed that the plans of 1724 and 1889 differ
considerably as to the dimensions and outline of the central
chamber. Although the earlier one was "delineated with
care and accuracy, upon the place," by "Mr. Samuel Molyneux,
a young gentleman of the college of Dublin," one
must rather accept the testimony of so experienced and
careful an archæologist as Mr. Wakeman. But the plan of
1724 has this great merit, that it was executed only twenty-nine
years after the re-opening of the "brugh"; and, consequently,
it shows (marked with the letter H) "a pyramid
stone now fallen, but formerly set up erect in the middle of
the cave." Moreover, Mr. Molyneux was able to give a
sketch of the carvings above the right hand, or eastern recess,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
when these were much fresher than at any period during
this century. A fac-simile of this picture is here given; and
if the artistic style of the draughtsman is not very admirable
it will at least be admitted that his work possesses a high
archæological value. But before quitting the subject of the
drawing of 1724, it must be pointed out that although Mr.
Molyneux shows, in the northern recess of his ground-plan,
a rude basin similar to those still occupying the eastern and
western recesses, yet the account of Mr. Edward Llhwyd,
stated to have been written in 1699,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> distinctly says that that
recess was <i>then</i> vacant. If Mr. Llhwyd's statement is correct
the plan of 1724 is obviously misleading in this respect.</p>

<p>The statements of those early writers are deserving of
full consideration, for they wrote before the effects of the
outside air and the unscientific tourist could have appreciably
altered the appearance of the chamber, since it was
entered in 1695. Their accounts, therefore, are quoted afterwards
at greater length.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> But, from what has been said, and
from an inspection of these illustrations, a good idea may
be gained of the exterior and interior appearance of the
habitation in which tradition states that Angus Og "magnificently
dwelt."</p>

<p>Something may here be said regarding this personage, and
the race to which he belonged. He is said to have been the
King of the Tuatha De Danann, a race traditionally believed
to have been the immediate precursors of the Gaels in Ireland.
They are sometimes spoken of as "the Dananns" or "Danaans";
sometimes also as "the Tuatha De, or Dea." <i>Tuatha</i>
merely signifies "people"; but the two other names do not
seem to have received any definite interpretation. It is said
that they migrated from "Lochlin" (Scandinavia, or perhaps
also Northern Germany) to the north-eastern Lowlands of
Scotland; and Dr. Skene notes that the topography of that
district supports the theory in several details.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

(or Milesians) came to Ireland&mdash;from Spain, it is said. It
was at this period that "Aonghus Mac an Daogha," otherwise
Angus, son of "the Dagda," was king of the Tuatha
De Danann. The story goes that the Dananns, recognizing
that the Gaels came as powerful and warlike invaders, and
as colonizers, told them on their first arrival that if they could
effect a landing in open day, and in spite of the Dananns,
then one-half of Ireland would be ceded to the new-comers.
The Gaels were successful; but the two parties could not
agree as to the division of Ireland,&mdash;apparently because the
Tuatha De Danann, while willing to surrender one-half of
the island, wished to retain the sovereignty of the whole.
Then, after the simple fashion of the heroes of ancient
chronicles, the rival forces came to the agreement that the
matter should be laid before the first person whom a party
of deputies from either side should happen to encounter at
the outskirts of a certain town, on an appointed day, and
this man's decision should be held as final. Now, although
the Dananns are remembered as "adepts in all Druidical
and magical arts," the Gaels also had a <i>druidh</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, wizard
or <i>magus</i>) among their number; who proved more than a
match for the Dananns. For, between him and the leaders
of his party it was arranged that the man whom the deputies
should accidentally meet at the appointed place should be
no other than this <i>druidh</i> of the Gaels, whose person was
unknown to their opponents. The unsuspecting Dananns
walked into the trap. The first man that the delegates met
was a strolling harper. "It is a great thing thou hast to do
to-day, good master of the sciences!" was the greeting of
Angus Mac Dagda, who was one of the company. "What
have I to be doing to-day?" quoth the wise man, "except to
go about with my harp, and learn who shall best reward me
for my music."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> "Thy task is far greater than that,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
answered Angus, "thou hast to divide Ireland into two
equal portions." Thereupon the <i>druidh</i>, having obtained the
promise of either side that they would abide by his decision,
pronounced as follows:&mdash;"This, then, is my decision. As
ye, O magical Dananns, have for a long period possessed
that half of Ireland which is above ground, henceforth the
half which is underneath the surface shall be yours, and the
half above ground shall belong to the Sons of Miledh (the
Milesians, or Gaels). To thee, O Angus, son of the Dagda,
as thou art the king of the Tuatha De Danann, I assign the
best earth-house in Ireland, the white-topped <i>brugh</i> of the
Boyne.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> As for the rest, each one can select an earth-house
for himself." Against this grotesque decision there was,
obviously, no appeal, and the Dananns surrendered the
surface of Ireland to the Gaels; "and retaining only the
green mounds, known by the name of Sidh, and then being
made invisible by their enchantments, became the Fir Sidhe,
or Fairies, of Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>In this legend of the "halving" of Ireland, Dr. Skene
recognizes the memory of a historical fact,&mdash;the conquest of
Ireland by the Gaels, and the terms meted out by them to
the natives. The tradition has of course its defects, like
most traditions. The "earth-houses" referred to<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> must have
already been in existence before they could be spoken of,
and particularized, by the magician of the Gaels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
The inference
to be drawn from the story is that the Tuatha De
Danann were themselves mound-dwellers, and that the terms
imposed upon them by the Gaels restricted the conquered
people to their own habitations, presumably with the
reservation of a small portion of the adjoining territory.
That, in short, the Gaelic conquest denoted a state of things
analogous to the European conquest and settlement of North
America, where the native races, having once submitted,
were allowed to live on "reservations," scattered here and
there throughout the country. Thus, as in America, the
two races would live side by side, though perhaps, as in
America, presenting the most opposite characteristics.</p>

<p>The above story states that the Fir Sidhe, or Dananns,
were confined to those "hollow hills" by the Gaels, through
the instrumentality of their <i>druidh</i>. The version which Mr.
William Black indicates as current in Southern Ireland,
ascribes this act to <i>the saints</i>. In his novel of <i>Shandon Bells</i>,
he introduces the hero and heroine as standing in "the very
headquarters of the elves and the pixies"; and the girl asks
"'Is this where you said the saints shut up Don Fierna and
the pixies?' 'No,' he said, 'that was away over there
in the mountains. But they say the little people can get out
into this valley; and you won't catch many of the Inisheen
natives about here after dark!'" Here, then, it is a Gaelic
<i>saint</i> and not a Gaelic <i>druidh</i> who was instrumental in confining
"the little people" to their homes; but, after all,
there is perhaps not much difference between <i>saint</i> and
<i>druidh</i>. The Fierna here referred to, it may be remarked, is
that King of the Sidhfir of Munster, who has been spoken of
on a previous page,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and whose dwelling, according to tradition,
was the hill of <i>Knockfierin</i>, in the neighbourhood of
Limerick.</p>

<p>The Tuatha De Danann, therefore, are the Sidhfir, or
Fairies, of Irish tradition. But the Tuatha De Danann have
been already referred to in these pages.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> "Who were the
Feinne of tradition, and to what country and period are they
to be assigned?" This is the question put by Dr. Skene.
And after considering the various Irish traditions relating
to "the Feinne," his conclusion is this: "The Feinne, then,
belonged to the pre-Milesian races, and were connected, not
only with Ireland, but likewise with Northern and Central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Scotland, England and Wales, and the territory lying between
the Rhine and the Elbe. [This last-named territory,
being "Lochlin," ought perhaps to be held as including the
whole of Scandinavia.] Now, there are just two people
mentioned in the Irish records who had settlements in
Ireland, and who yet were connected with Great Britain and
'Lochlin.' These were the people termed the Tuatha De
Danann, and the Cruithne.... These two tribes were
thus the prior race in each country [Ireland and North and
Central Scotland]. Both must have been prior to the Low
German population of Lochlan. The Cruithne were the race
prior to the Scots [Gaels] in North and Central Scotland,
and the Tuatha De Danann the prior colony to the Milesian
Scots in Ireland. The Feinne are brought by all the old
historic tales into close contact with the Tuatha De Danann;
a portion of them were avowedly Cruithne; and if they
were, as we have seen, in Ireland, not of the Milesian race,
but of the prior population, and likewise connected with
Great Britain and the region lying between the Rhine and
the Elbe, the inference is obvious, that, whether a denomination
for an entire people or for a body of warriors, they
belonged to the previous population which preceded the
Germans in Lochlan and the Gaels in Ireland and North
and Central Scotland. This view is corroborated by the
fact, that in the old poems and tales the Feinne appear, as
we have said, in close connection with the Tuatha De Danann.
They are likewise connected with the Cruithne.... In
answering, then, the preliminary questions of who were the
Feinne? and to what period do they belong? we may fairly
infer that they were of the population who immediately
preceded the Gaels in Ireland and in North and Central
Scotland."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>The Feinne, then, belonged to the population which
comprised the Cruithne and the Tuatha De Danann, or
Sidhfir, or Fairies. But the Cruithne, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> were
the Picts of history, and the "Pechts" of Scottish folk-lore.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Thus, the Feinne were of the population of "Pechts and
Fairies." It has already been shown that to draw a hard
and fast line between these two divisions is impossible.
Nevertheless, there seems to have been once some kind of
distinction between the two. And if the Feinne must
necessarily have been "Pechts <i>or</i> Fairies" (as the above
conclusions of Dr. Skene's seem to warrant), then they
appear to have belonged to the former division. Or, in other
words, they were <i>Cruithne</i> rather than <i>Tuatha De Danann</i>.
It may be remembered that in such a Fenian ballad as the
<i>Dan an Fhir Shicair</i>, or Song of the Fairy Man,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> the
Feinne are represented as associating with the Sidhfir (say
Tuatha De Danann), but yet not as <i>identical</i> with them.
Again, the same dubiety was seen in the references to the
hoards of treasure obtained by the ninth-century Danes
from "the hidden places belonging to Fians <i>or</i> to Fairies,"<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
in the valley of the Boyne.</p>

<p>The Brugh of the Boyne is several times spoken of by
Professor Eugene O'Curry in his "Lectures on the Manuscript
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Materials of Ancient Irish History."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> For example,
as an illustration of the use of the word <i>sidh</i> to denote "a
hall or residence" of the <i>sidh</i>-folk Mr. O'Curry cites a
stanza "taken from an ancient poem by Mac Nia, son of
Oenna (in the Book of Ballymote, fol. 190, b.) on the wonders
of <i>Brugh</i> (or <i>Brog</i>) <i>na Boinne</i> (the Palace of the Boyne),
the celebrated Hall of the Daghda Mór, who was the great
king and oracle of the <i>Tuata Dé Danann</i>. This poem," continues
Mr. O'Curry, "begins: '<i>A Chaemu Bregh Brig nad
Breg</i>' ('Ye Poets of Bregia, of truth, not false,') and this is
the second stanza of that poem:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>
'<i>Fegaid in sid ar for súil<br />

<br />
'Behold the <i>Sidh</i> before your eyes,<br />
It is manifest to you that it is a king's mansion,<br />
Which was built by the firm <i>Daghda</i>;<br />
It was a wonder, a court, an admirable hill.'"<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a><br />
</p></div>

<p>In the same work we read of an incident, placed in the
time of St. Patrick and subsequent to the Battle of Gawra,
when the conquered "Fianns" were only represented by a
few straggling survivors, one of whom was the well-known
<i>Caeilté</i> (as the name is here spelt). "Saint Patrick, with
his travelling missionary retinue, including Caeilté we are
told, was one day sitting on the hill which is now well known
as Ard-Patrick, in the county of Limerick." Questioning
Caeilté as to the former name of this hill, St. Patrick learned
that it had been called <i>Tulach-na-Feiné</i>, and obtained also
an anecdote suggested by it. "One day that we were on
this hill," says Caeilté, speaking of himself and his brother
"Fianns," "Finn observed a favourite warrior of his company,
named Cael O'Neamhain, coming towards him, and when he
had come to Finn's presence, he asked him where he had
come from. Cael answered that he had come from <i>Brugh</i> in
the north (that is the fairy mansion of <i>Brugh</i>, on the Boyne).<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
'What was your business there?' said Finn.
'To speak to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> my nurse, Muirn, the daughter of Derg,' said Cael. 'About
what?' said Finn. 'Concerning Credé, the daughter of
Cairbré, King of Kerry (<i>Ciarraighe Luachra</i>),' said Cael?"
And so on. At another place<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> the dialogue goes thus:&mdash;"'Where
hast thou come from, Cael?' said Finn. 'From
the teeming <i>Brugh</i>, from the North,' said Cael. ('<i>As in Brug
Braenach atuaid,' ar Cael</i>)." And so on, to the same purpose
as in the other version. In this story, then, we see the
"Fians and Fairies" associated with each other, as in <i>The
Ballad of the Fairy Man</i>; and the nurse of one of the Fians
is described as living in the "brugh" which was built by the
celebrated chief of the Tuatha De Danann, and was afterwards
tenanted by his son, Angus Og.</p>

<p>Among Mr. O'Curry's notes there is this reference to
Angus Og:<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> "In the <i>Dinnsenchus</i> it is stated that '<i>Eóin
Bailé</i>' were Four Kisses of Aengus of <i>Brugh na Boinné</i> (son
of the <i>Daghda Mor</i>, the great necromancer and king of
the <i>Tuatha Dé Danann</i>), which were converted by him into
'birds which haunted the youths of Erinn.' This allusion,"
remarks Mr. O'Curry, "requires more investigation than I
have yet been able to bestow on the passage." Whatever
the "<i>Eóin Bailé</i>" may have been, or have been assumed to
be, this passage brings into prominence the fact that the
people known as Tuatha De Danann, or Fir-Sidhe, were
regarded by other races as possessed of supernatural power,
and were indeed actually revered as gods at one era. As the
biographer of St. Patrick says of him:&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>
"He preached threescore years<br />
The Cross of Christ to the <i>Tuatha</i> [people] of Feni.<br />
On the <i>Tuatha</i> of Erin there was darkness.<br />
The <i>Tuatha</i> adored the <i>Side</i>."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a><br />
</p></div>

<p>(Here, of course, the <i>Fir</i> Sidhe, or people of the "sidhs"
are denoted; the word being sometimes used to indicate the
dwellers, sometimes the dwellings.) And the exalted character
of the inmates of the Brugh of the Boyne is indicated
also in a verse of a Gaelic poem entitled <i>Baile Suthain Sith</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
<i>Eamhna</i>,
which dates back to the year 1457 at least. The
subject of the verse referred to is thus apostrophized:&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>
"Thou, the son of noble Sabia,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thou the most beauteous apple rod;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>What god from Bru of the Boyne</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Created thee with her in secret?"<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span><br />
</p></div>

<p>This exalted position "the little people" seem to have
retained in some measure long after their subjugation, and
even the household drudge or "brownie" was feared for
his alleged "supernatural" power. The fact that the common
people of Ireland at the present day speak of the
inhabitants of the "brughs" or "sheeans" as "the gentry,"
may also be regarded as a witness to the superior rank once
held by that caste whose mound-dwellings are exemplified
by this "Brugh of the Boyne" and others in its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Of the undoubtedly historic spoliation of those Boyne
"hillocks" in the ninth century, something more may be
said here. "We have on record," says Lady Ferguson,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
"both in the Irish chronicles and the Norse <i>Sagas</i>, that in
the year 861 the three earls, Olaf, Sitric, and Ivar, opened,
for purposes of plunder, the sepulchral mounds of New
Grange, Dowth, and Knowth on the Boyne, and the mound
of the wife of the Gobaun Saer,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> the mythic builder, or
Wayland Smith of the Irish Celts, still a conspicuous object
at Drogheda."</p>

<p>One of the Irish chronicles referred to by Lady Ferguson is
that known as the "Annals of Ulster" ("compiled in the year
1498," says Dr. Skene), and the passage is as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
"Aois Cr. ocht cced seascca a haon, ... Amlaoibh, Iomhair, 7<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>

<p>This is rendered into Latin by Dr. O'Conor thus: "Ætas
Christi DCCCLXI..... Amlafus, Imarus et Magnates
trium Ducum Alienigenarum, et Lorcanus filius Cathaldi
Princeps Midiæ, vastant terras Flanni filii Conangi. Crypta
subterranea campi Alda in regione Mugdornorum planitiei,
Crypta Cnovæ, Cryptæ miraculorum Bodani supra Dubath,
et Crypta f&#0339;minæ fabri apud Droghedam, vastatæ et
destructæ ab Alienigenis iisdem."</p>

<p>Neither Dr. Todd nor Dr. Skene, however, have a high
opinion of O'Conor's translation.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> And his rendering of
"Uailsi" by "Magnates" is palpably a blunder based upon
the acceptance of that word as <i>uaillse</i> or <i>uaisle</i>, a nobleman;
whereas, Uailsi, Oisli, Oisill, &amp;c., was the name of a comrade
(some accounts say a brother) of the Olaf and Ivor referred
to.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Thus, the Annals state that in 861, Olaf (or Anlaf,
or Aulay), Ivor and Uailsi (or Oisli), three chiefs of the
Foreigners, and Lorcan, son of Cathal, lord of Meath,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
devastated the lands of Flann, son of Conang; in other words,
the territory of "Bregia,&mdash;a district including the counties
of Meath, Westmeath, Dublin (north of the Liffey), and part
of Louth."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> And these same "foreigners" pillaged and
destroyed certain underground chambers, which O'Conor
refers to as "crypts." The term is correct enough, signifying,
as it does, an underground place of concealment. But the
Gaelic term is more suitable, if the quickened pronunciation
which in many parts of Scotland has occasioned the spelling
"weem" (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>uaim</i>) be adopted.
For by "weem" is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
understood the subterranean gallery previously described, if
it is not at any time applied to the actual "hollow hill."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
Of the "weems" in the territory of Flann, which the <i>Annals</i>
state were plundered, three are easily recognized;&mdash;viz., that
of "Cnoghbha," the modern "Knowth" (which is portrayed
in the accompanying plate), the still more celebrated "Uaimh
Feirt Bodan," described as "above Dubath,"<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> now known
as Dowth, which is also here represented, and thirdly, the
"weem" of the wife of the <i>Gobban Saor</i>, or "noble smith,"
at Drogheda. The first-named of all is said to be that of the
"Brugh of the Boyne," at New Grange; and no doubt there
is evidence for this identification, although the term "Mugdhornaibh
Maighen" would otherwise lead one to place this
"weem" at "Mugornn or Mugdhorn, now Cremorne,"<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> in
the county of Monaghan.</p>

<p>Two of these "weems" are mentioned in the Gaelic poem
of <i>Sith Eamhna</i>, wherein, as has been seen, "the son of noble
Sabia" was assumed to be equally the son of some god
"from Bru of the Boyne." In this poem, whose meaning is
somewhat obscure, there are several references to the Boyne
and to various "broghs," of which one is "the cave of Ferna,
the fair cave of Knowth (<i>uaim fhearna</i>, <i>uaim chaomh
cnodhbha</i>, or <i>chnoghdha</i>)." This <i>Sith Eamhna</i> itself appears
to have been of the same order, and not improbably was
that Eamhain which was "the ancient palace of the kings
of Ulster." "The ruins of Eamhain, or, as it is now
corruptly called, the Navan Fort, are to be seen about two
miles to the west of Armagh," says Mr. O'Donovan, in a
note to his "Book of Rights."<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> This is certainly farther
north than the territory of Flann Mc Conang, ravaged by
the "foreigners" in 861, as defined on a previous page; but
one writer states that that territory of "Bregia" (or <i>Breagh</i>)
extended into Ulster, in the eighth century;<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and if the
plundered "weem" first-named in the <i>Annals</i> was really in
county Monaghan, that would show that a portion of
"Breagh" was situated in Ulster in 861.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>Eamhain, or Emania (in the Latinized form), appears to
have given its name to all Ulster, but in its proper application
the term refers to the stronghold itself. Dr. Skene
speaks of "the fall of the great seat of the Cruithnian
kingdom called Emania, before an expedition, led by a scion
of the Scottish (<i>i.e.</i>, Gaelic) royal race, who established the
kingdom of Orgialla on its ruins."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> It is this place that is
associated with Oscar, the hero of the "Fians," at the time
of the Battle of Gawra; and it may be remembered that, in
a poem describing that battle, a chief of one section of the
"Fian" confederacy is made to exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I and the Fians of Breatan</span><br />
Will be with Oscar of <i>Eamhain</i>."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>And as Oscar is stated to have been slain at the Battle of
Gawra, and the power of the "Fians" destroyed, one is
tempted to believe that the legendary battle of Gawra
coincides with the historical capture of Oscar's stronghold of
Emhain, and the downfall of the historical Cruithné of
Ulster. However, <i>Sith Eamhna</i> has been mentioned here
not for its own sake, but for the casual references in that
poem to the "Brugh of the Boyne" and "the cave of Ferna,
the fair cave of Knowth."</p>

<p>The Gaelic records as well as the Scandinavian have
many tales of "how-breaking" exploits. For, although the
accounts of the Feenic "heroes" have been preserved to
us in the Gaelic language, as those of the Longobards
have been preserved in Latin, it does not follow in the
one case more than in the other, that the language of
the chronicle was the language of the chronicled. Whatever
may have been wrought eventually, by time and
intercourse, the Gaelic-speaking people appear originally as
the plunderers of "the hidden places of the Fians and
Fairies." Professor O'Curry states that among the Historic
Tales in the <i>Book of Leinster</i>, there are many which deal
specially with adventures in "caves" or, otherwise, "weems."
Tales of this class are called <i>Uatha</i>.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
"These are tales
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
respecting various occurrences in caves; sometimes the
taking of a cave, when the place has been used as a place of
refuge or habitation,&mdash;and such a taking would be, in fact, a
sort of <i>Toghail</i> [the <i>Toghail</i> having been previously defined
as a history 'which details the taking of a fort or fortified
palace or habitation by force ... the term always implies
the destruction of the buildings taken.']; sometimes the
narrative of some adventure in a cave; sometimes of a
plunder of a cave." Mr. O'Curry gives a list of the <i>uatha</i>
in the "Book of Leinster"; and of these the most noteworthy
is the <i>Uath Uama Cruachan</i>, or the Plundering of the Weem
of Cruachan. This is referred to as "a very curious story,"
and the ravagers are said to have been "the men of Connacht,
in the time of Ailill and Meadhbh, as told in the old tale of
<i>Táin Bo Aingen</i>." This Meadhbh, or Maev, of Cruachan,
"the Semiramis of Irish history," as Lady Ferguson calls
her, has herself been identified with the "Queen Mab" of
fairy tradition. She appears to have occupied this "Uama
Cruachan" after it had been plundered; for it is stated that
her husband "re-edified the Rath of Cruachan, employing
for the purpose a fierce tribe of Firbolgic origin, the <i>Gowanree</i>,
who were compelled to labour unremittingly at the earthworks,
and are said to have completed the dyke in one day."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
Mr. O'Curry has another reference to this place. "I have in
my possession," he says, "a poem in the Ossianic style,
which gives an account of a foot race between Cailté, the
celebrated champion of Finn Mac Cumhaill, and an unknown
knight who had challenged him. The race terminated by
the stranger running into the Cave of Cruachain, followed
by Cailté, where he found a party of smiths at work, etc.
No copy of the full Tale has come down to us." This incident
is remarkable for its association of one of the "Fians"
with the underground smiths of tradition. Another <i>uath</i>
mentioned by Mr. O'Curry is the <i>Uath Dercce Ferna</i>, regarding
which he says:&mdash;"There is an allusion to the trampling
to death of some sort of monster, in the mouth of this cave,
by a Leinsterwoman, in a poem on the Graves of Heroes
who were killed by Leinstermen, preserved in the Book of
Leinster (H. 2. 18, fol. 27, Trin. Coll. Dubl.)."</p>

<p>Of the plans and sectional views of these chambered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
mounds of the Boyne valley which are here given, it is not
necessary to say much in these pages. "Dowth" has been
explored and described by others, although the accompanying
pictures, being new, and the work of the experienced archæologist
referred to, add very considerably to the knowledge
of the subject. The main gallery and chamber of Dowth
resembles generally that of the "Brugh of the Boyne" at New
Grange; but the central chamber is not nearly so spacious.</p>

</div>

<p>The "bee-hive" chamber which the Dowth mound also contains
has no duplicate at New Grange, but it is quite possible
that each of these mounds has yet something to disclose.
Dowth also reminds the explorer and excavator, by the deep
hollow made in the upper portion, in the course of a fruitless
and abandoned search, some years ago, that to attack these
mounds at random is to run the risk of much useless and
disappointing labour. It moreover shows that any upward
exit from the central chamber did not in this instance ascend
perpendicularly as in the Denghoog at Sylt, or the Orcadian
Maes-how. In trying to find the entrances to such "hollow
hills," we moderns have no light to guide us as the Danes had
in the ninth century. It will be remembered that there never
was, "in concealment under ground in Erinn, nor in the
various secret places belonging to Fians or to fairies, anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
that was not discovered by these foreign, wonderful
Denmarkians, through paganism and idol worship."</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 326px;"><a name="i168" id="i168"></a>

<p class="caption">BEE-HIVE CHAMBER, DOWTH.</p>
</div>

<p>This is
otherwise explained by Dr. Todd, "that, notwithstanding the
potent spells employed by the Fians and fairies for the concealment
of their hidden treasures, the Danes, by their pagan
magic and the diabolical power of their idols, were enabled
to find them out." What was the "magic" of those ninth-century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Danes, or of the order generally known as <i>Magi</i>, we
only imperfectly know. But what is tolerably evident is that
if those ninth-century Danes did not themselves rear similar
structures (and Irish and Hebridean tradition says they did),
they had among them those to whom such mound-dwellings
were not "hidden" places; whether the entrances were
uniformly made at one side of the mound, or were otherwise
indicated to the initiated. In the case of "Knowth" there
is less dubiety; as what appears to be the entrance to its
interior is known to Irish archæologists. But local difficulties
have hitherto stood in the way, and the mound is
said never to have been entered since the ninth century;
which, however, may be doubted. Dr. Molyneux, at any
rate, in the tract quoted in Appendix A, states that he had
then in his possession a stone urn which "was twelve years
since [<i>i.e.</i> in 1713] discovered in a mount at <i>Knowth</i>, a place
in the county of <i>Meath</i>, within four miles of <i>Drogheda</i>."
He does not actually say that this urn, and the "square
stone box, about five foot long and four foot broad" which
contained it, were situated in an interior chamber of the
mound. But very probably this is what he meant.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>Such barrows as these of the Boyne district belong to the
largest class of these structures at present revealed to us.
What may be taken as the average "fairy knowe" is very
much smaller; therefore, when it is said that houses have, in
all likelihood, been frequently built upon such artificial eminences,
without the more modern builders being aware of
their real nature, it is to be understood that the tumuli of
the larger class are indicated. But, while it is probable that
newer races very often built thus unconsciously upon the outer
crust of the habitations of the mound-dwellers, it is still more
likely that, in course of time, the central chamber of the
mound became by slow degrees the dungeon of a fort or
castle that had evolved itself from it. When a "how" of the
larger class had been "broken" by invaders, and its inmates
despoiled and killed or enslaved, their conquerors would
quickly realize that this artificial mound, rising out of a level
plain, formed an admirable site for a stronghold; and, indeed,
that the only thing immediately necessary was to throw up a
rampart round the top of the hill. To races who had no
fancy for the subterranean manner of living, the strongholds
of their predecessors would not suffice, although they would
still prove very serviceable as cellars, or dungeons, or as forming
a secret way of access to the castle which would eventually
tower above them. Where the subject race was not exterminated,
the former lord of the "broch" would still live on
as the serf of his conqueror, and, on account of his physical
peculiarities, he would be remembered as his master's "dwarf,"
or "brownie," while the women of his race, still claiming their
inherited "supernatural" power, would be represented by the
prophetic half-dreaded "banshee" (<i>ban-sithe</i>, or fairy-woman)
that foretold the destinies of the house of her over-lord. It is
a significant fact that the possession of a family "banshee" in
Ireland is restricted to these families who trace their descent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
from the Milesians (Scots), the conquerers of the Cruithné or
Pechts. And we are told that, at one time, in Shetland, where
the Pechts became the subject race, "almost every family had
a <i>brownie</i> ... which served them."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Innumerable references
of this kind might be given. There is, for instance,
the case of the "brownie" who was the attendant of Maclachlan
of Stralachlan, in Argyllshire, and who is said to
have "inhabited a vault in the dungeons of the castle" (Castle
Lachlan), but who, like other "brownies," was accredited with
prophetic powers!<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Then there is the "little chap with a red
cap on his head," referred to in a story told to the late J. F.
Campbell;<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> and this "little chap" is understood to occupy
the cellar of a "haunted house"; which, as it was inhabited
by "ladies and gentlemen," and must be assigned to the
period when such "red caps" existed, was not unlikely a
"house" of the same order as the castles just spoken of.</p>

<p>Such an example of a mediæval castle, the flower of a
plant rooted in the interior of such a mound, may be recognized
in Kenilworth. According to local tradition, the hill
upon which Kenilworth Castle is built was once inhabited by
fairies, who are remembered by the same characteristics as
their kindred elsewhere. But the consideration of a Warwickshire
mound might lead us too far away from the dwarfs
more specially known as Picts or Pechts, and therefore it is
better to continue as much as possible within the area already
examined. It is enough to note that the Kenilworth dwarfs,
in the days when their mound was merely a subterranean
vault of the great castle overhead, and themselves nothing
more than the "Redcaps" of the cellar, formed a marked
contrast to the once dreaded "shag-boys" or mound-dwellers,
as these are remembered in Lincolnshire tradition.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p>However, if Kenilworth is too far south to be recognized as
a home of the historical Pechts, Ancient Northumbria has
not the same objection against it. And in East Lothian,
which is a portion of that province, a certain Castle of Yester
was once famous for its "Goblin Hall," which is thus described
in the Appendix to "Marmion" (note 2 P):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>The Goblin Hall.</i>&mdash;A vaulted hall under the ancient castle of Gifford
or Yester (for it bears either name indifferently), the construction of
which has from a very remote period been ascribed to magic....
'Upon a peninsula, formed by the water of Hopes on the east, and a
large rivulet on the west, stands the ancient castle of Yester. Sir David
Dalrymple, in his annals, relates that "Hugh Gifford de Yester died in
1267; that in his castle there was a capacious cavern, formed by magical
art, and called in the country Bo-Hall, <i>i.e.</i>, Hobgoblin Hall." A stair of
twenty-four steps led down to this apartment, which is a large and
spacious hall, with an arched roof.... From the floor of this hall
another stair of thirty-six steps leads down to a pit which hath a communication
with Hopeswater....'"</p></blockquote>

<p>In this instance, the "pit" which communicated with the
neighbouring stream was probably the original underground
dwelling; and if the arch of the "vaulted hall" above it is
not of the "Pelasgic" order, it is to be presumed that the
"goblins"<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> who built it had received fresh ideas from a race
possessed of a more advanced civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>The castle of Doune, in Perthshire, is another probable
instance of the mediæval castle evolved from the primitive
mound. What is nowadays known as the castle of "Doune,"
was formerly spoken of as "The Dùn (or Doon) of Menteith."
"Doune (Dun, no doubt) had once, where its castle
now stands, an ancient fortress; but the name is all that now
remains to bespeak it," says a lady-writer on this subject.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> It
is very probable, therefore, that the original "Doon of Menteith"
was the mound upon which the present building now
stands; and that this was at one time the chief stronghold of
the district of Menteith. One <i>doon</i>, which has apparently
never advanced from its earliest stage, is that of Rothiemurchus,
in the district of Badenoch (Inverness-shire). "A
mound which has every appearance of having been used in
ancient times for purposes of defence stands at the Doun of
Rothiemurchus, and is properly the <i>Doun</i> or <i>Dun</i>," says a
modern historian of that district.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Such a structure as this
seems to combine the dwelling and the fort; the "hollow
hill" having presumably been so constructed as to render the
"crater" on its summit a place of defence. That this Doon
of Rothiemurchus was once inhabited seems clearly indicated.
In speaking of the <i>ban-sithe</i>, or fairy woman, already referred
to as the appanage of old Milesian families, Sir Walter Scott
states that "most great families in the Highlands" were thus
distinguished, and that "Grant of Rothiemurcus had an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
attendant called <i>Bodach-an-dùn</i>";<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> in other words, "The
Goblin of the Doon." And when Scott states, in the <i>note</i>
immediately preceding that just quoted, that "a goblin,
dressed in antique armour, and having one hand covered with
blood, called from that circumstance <i>Lamh-dearg</i>, or Red-hand,
is a tenant of the forests of Glenmore and Rothiemurcus,"
he indicates a tradition that seems to be connected with
the "goblins" of the Doon of Rothiemurchus.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>However, although referred to in passing, the Rothiemurchus
mound is not one of those on which a stone castle has
been subsequently reared. But of the latter class an example
is furnished by the "Castle Hill" of Clunie, in Perthshire.
It is thus described in Sir John Sinclair's "Statistical
Account":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"On the western shore of the loch of Clunie stands the old castle-hill,
a large, green mound, partly natural and partly artificial, on the top of
which are the ruins of a very old building. Some aged persons still alive
[in the end of last century] remember to have seen a small aperture, now
invisible, at the edge of one of the fragments of the ruins, where, if a
stone was thrown in, it was heard for some time, as if rolling down a
staircase. From this it seems probable that were a section of the hill
to be made, some curious discoveries might be the consequence."</p></blockquote>

<p>Resembling Fierna's Hillock, near Limerick, in its having
this "small aperture," communicating with an unexplored
vault below, this Perthshire mound is also celebrated, like
Knock-Fierna, for its association with the "fairies." The
castle which once crowned its summit has more historical
memories.</p>

<p>Of this castle, in which, it is said, King Edward I. of England
passed a night, in the course of his triumphant progress
through Scotland in 1296, almost nothing now remains. But
a tradition relating to an earlier period asserts that this place
was once a hunting-seat of Kenneth McAlpin, the ninth-century
conqueror of the Picts (whose king he subsequently
became). Although Kenneth, and his son after him, bore
the title of "King of the Picts," it is tolerably clear that he
was a Scot or Milesian by race, and it is certain that he broke
up the power of the Pechts in Central Scotland. As he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
not one of this latter race himself, it is probable that any
"hunting-seat" possessed by him at this place took the shape
of an above-ground building, and that therefore the memories
of the "supernatural" inhabitants of this mound date back
to the time when it was still an unconquered stronghold of
the Pechts. As, however, the suggested "section of the hill"
has never yet been made, nothing definite is at present known
regarding the interior of this mound.</p>

<p>One of the incidents relating to the "goblin" of Rothiemurchus
is included by Mr. J. F. Campbell among the
traditions obtained by him from the district of Badenoch,
in Inverness-shire. "The Badenoch account of the fairies"
is stated to be "much the same" as those from other parts
of the Highlands, and they show "that according to popular
belief, fairies commonly carried off men, women and children,
who seemed to die, but really lived underground." A tale
of this kind, "now commonly believed in Badenoch," is to
this effect:&mdash;A man who, returning home after a short
absence, found that his wife had disappeared and that another
woman had taken her place, demanded from the latter,
on pain of death, to tell him where his wife had been conveyed
to. "She told him that his wife had been carried to
Cnoc Fraing, a mountain on the borders of Badenoch and
Strathdearn." "The man went to Cnoc Fraing. He was
suspected before of having something supernatural about
him; and he soon found the fairies, who told him his wife
had been taken to Shiathan Mor, a neighbouring mountain.
He went there and was sent to Tom na Shirich, near
Inverness. There he went, and at the 'Fairy Knoll' found
his wife and brought her back."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Campbell adds that "the person who related this story
pretended to have seen people who knew distant descendants
of the woman"&mdash;but beyond indicating that the tradition
is very old, this does not place these events in any particular
century. The localities named, however, are full of suggestiveness.
Of <i>Cnoc Fraing</i>, nothing is known to the present
writer. But "Shiathan Mor," to which the woman is said
to have been first taken, signifies "The Great Hill of
the Fairies." Such a name is of very frequent occurrence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
in the Highlands. One who is well versed in these matters
says: "There is perhaps not a hamlet or township in the
Highlands or Hebrides without its <i>shian</i> or green fairy knoll
so-called. Within half a mile of our own residence, for example,
there is a <i>Sithean Beag</i> and a <i>Sithean Mor</i>, a Lesser
and Greater Fairy Knoll."<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> In the Hebridean island of
Colonsay, where Martin, the eighteenth-century traveller,
found that "the natives have a tradition among them of a
very little generation of people that lived once here, called
Lusbirdan, the same with pigmies," one finds a "Sheean
Mor" and a "Sheean Beg," along with many other traces
of those people.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> But it is unnecessary to multiply special
instances. It was to a Great Knoll of the Fairies, then, that
the woman was taken, and thereafter to "Tom na Shirich,
near Inverness." This name also signifies "Hill of the
Fairies." <i>Shirich</i>, more correctly <i>Sibhreach</i>, is apparently a
less common form, equivalent to Sidhfear, Duine Sith, etc.,
but it occurs more than once in the "West Highland Tales,"<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
both as a singular and a plural. When the initial "s" of
<i>sibhreach</i> or <i>sithreach</i>, becomes aspirated, after the common
Gaelic fashion, the sibilant is no longer heard; and this is
exemplified in the case of "Tom na Shirich," which is
nowadays spelt as it is pronounced&mdash;<i>Tomnahurich</i> (or
<i>Tomnaheurich</i>, etc.)<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Of this Inverness hill much has been
written.</p>

<p>It is sometimes called <i>Tomman-heurich</i>, and spoken of as
a <i>tomman</i>, which connects it with the word <i>tulman</i> or <i>tolman</i>,
already referred to. Hugh Miller, in speaking of "that
Queen of Scottish tomhans, the picturesque Tomnahuirich,"
employs both forms at the same time, which is contradictory.
Pennant, who visited it last century, refers to it also as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
<i>tomman</i>. In his <i>Tour</i> he thus describes "the strange-shaped
hill of Tomman heurich:"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Tomman is of an oblong form, broad at the base, and sloping
on all sides towards the top; so that it looks like a ship with its keel
upwards.... It is perfectly detached from any other hill; and if it was
not for its great size, might pass for a work of art." "Its length at top
[is] about 300 yards; I neglected measuring the base or the height, which
are both considerable; the breadth of the top [is] only twenty yards."</p></blockquote>

<p>Captain Burt, in his "Letters from a Gentleman in the
North of Scotland" (Letter XII.) speaks of it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"About a mile westward from the town [Inverness] there rises, out of
a perfect flat, a very regular hill; whether natural or artificial, I could
never find by any tradition; the natives call it <i>tommanheurach</i>. It is
almost in the shape of a Thames wherry, turned keel upwards, for which
reason they sometimes call it Noah's Ark. The length of it is about
four hundred yards, and the breadth at bottom about one hundred and
fifty. From below, at every point of view, it seems to end at top in a
narrow ridge; but when you are there, you find a plain large enough to
draw up two or three battalions of men. Hither we sometimes retire on
a summer's evening.... But this is not the only reason why I speak
of this hill; it is the weak credulity with which it is attended, that led me
to this detail; for as anything ever so little extraordinary, may serve
as a foundation (to such as are ignorant, heedless, or interested) for
ridiculous stories and imaginations, so the fairies within it are innumerable,
and witches find it the most convenient place for their frolics and
gambols in the night time."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, if this large hill, which "might pass for a work of
art," was really, as tradition states, the residence of the little
people known as dwarfs or Pechts, it was clearly an important
seat of those people. And, on regarding them from
the historian's point of view, one finds that this district was
specially so distinguished. "When we can first venture to
regard the list of the Pictish Kings preserved in the <i>Pictish
Chronicle</i> as having some claim to a historical character, we
find the king having his seat apparently in Forfarshire; but
when the works of Adamnan and Bede place us upon firm
ground, the monarch belonged to the race of the Northern
Picts, and had his fortified residence near the mouth of the
river Ness" [Inver-Ness]. And the same historian again
observes:&mdash;"Adamnan, writing in the seventh century, tells
us of the fortified residence of the king of the Picts on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
banks of the river Ness, with its royal house and gates, of
a village on the banks of a lake, and of the houses of the
country people."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>Hitherto, the place which has been regarded as most
likely the site of this seventh-century stronghold, is the
vitrified fort which crowns the summit of Craig Patrick (or
<i>Creag Phadruig</i>), a hill not far from Inverness. But the top
of a hill more than four hundred feet high can scarcely
be referred to as a situation "on the banks of the river
Ness," from which river it is, moreover, two miles distant.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
The situation of Tomnahurich, on the other hand, does
exactly answer to the description given. And this "hill,"
whose peculiar appearance has attracted the attention of
several travellers, is locally remembered as a celebrated
home of the "Pechts." Nor is it necessary to confine oneself
to the consideration of this hill alone. Adamnan speaks
not only of a royal residence, but also of "the houses of
the country people." "The country people" of whom he
speaks were Pechts, and their "houses," of course, were
"Pechts' houses"; "houses" such as the Fairy Knowe unearthed
at Coldoch, near Doune, already referred to. In
other words <i>sheeans</i>. Now, when Hugh Miller speaks of
"that Queen of Scottish tomhans, the picturesque Tomnahuirich,"
he states that it belongs to "a wonderful group"
of similar mounds "in the immediate neighbourhood of
Inverness." The "houses" of the mound-dwelling Pechts
had one admirable characteristic; they were almost indestructible.
If the King of the Dwarfs had his residence at
Inverness during the seventh century, with "the houses of
the country people," of the same race, scattered all through
the immediate neighbourhood, their dwellings must be there
still: and any one who wanted to localize them would
naturally turn to such mounds as the "wonderful groups" of
"tomhans" of which Hugh Miller speaks.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>Inverness, however, was not the only important centre of
Pictish power. Among others, there was Abernethy, a few
miles south-east of Perth. And at this place, says Small,
in his "Roman Antiquities of Fife," the spot wherein the
treasures of the Pictish king are believed to be hidden<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> was
guarded by a <i>droughy</i> (<i>droich</i> or <i>trow</i>) who fiercely assailed
any invader. Of the Pechts in that neighbourhood there
are many traditions.</p>

<p>A few miles to the west of Abernethy is Forteviot, where
Kenneth MacAlpin, the conqueror and ruler of the Pechts,
died in the latter part of the ninth century. Prior to the
successful invasion of Kenneth's race, this district&mdash;like that
of Abernethy and all the country north to Inverness&mdash;had
been inhabited by Pechts: and Forteviot is stated to have
been a seat of Pictish royalty. Some miles to the south-west
of Forteviot there is a hill called Ternavie, which has
characteristics similar to those of Tomnahuirich. "Ternavie
has been pronounced 'the most remarkable spot in this
parish or neighbourhood.' It is a hill or mound of earth
of a very curious form, occupying, when the Old Statistical
Account was written, 'many acres of ground, covered with
a fine sward of grass, and striking the eye at a distance of
several miles. It resembles in shape the keel of a ship inverted.'"
And local tradition asserts, says the writer quoted
from,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> that once upon a time, a countryman attempting to
obtain turf on the side of this hill, was suddenly confronted
by an old man who emerged from the hill, "and with an
angry countenance and tone of voice asked the countryman
why he was tirring (uncovering) his house over his head?"
This story does not say that the mound-dweller was a
dwarf, but here we have a hill whose appearance suggests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
that it is at least partly artificial, and local tradition alleges
that it was once inhabited. And this in the heart of Pictavia,
or the country of the Pechts.</p>

<p>In the same county, but farther to the west, there is a
locality which is remembered, like the island on the Ross-shire
loch, as a gathering-place or rendezvous of the little
people. It is situated in the valley of the Forth. The
"Fairy Knowes" of Coldoch have already been spoken of.
One of them, it was stated, has been opened, and its interior
shows to the most sceptical that the tradition which told that
it was a home of the dwarfs was absolutely correct. The
other "knowe," some hundreds of yards distant, has not as
yet been touched.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> But that it, too, was a dwelling of the
same "little people" is almost as certain as if the spade of
the excavator had already done its work.</p>

<p>But the gathering-place referred to lies nearer the sources
of the Forth than the "Fairy Knowe" of Coldoch and the
Doune of Menteith. Like these places, it is situated in the
district of Menteith, and beside the lake of that name, on its
south-eastern shore. This hillock is known as <i>Cnoc nam
Bocan</i>, or the Knowe of the Goblins, and we are told that it
used to be "the headquarters of the fairies of the whole district
of Menteith." These fairies, it is said, were employed
as the drudges of a former Earl of Menteith, in making the
small peninsula known as Arnmauk, which juts out from the
southern shore of the lake towards the small island of
Inchmahome. The earl, we are told, "in grateful acknowledgment
of the work they had done in forming the
peninsula, and wishing to be on good terms with them, made
a grant to them of the north shoulder of Ben Venue; which
is to this day called Coir-n'an-Uriskin, that is, the Cove of
the Urisks or Fairies."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> At this latter place, says another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
writer,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> "the solemn stated meetings of the order were
regularly held"; presumably at a later date.</p>

<p>However, "the north shoulder of Ben Venue" ought probably
to be regarded as the latest "reservation" accorded
to these little people. For, among the many "knowes" in
the district of Menteith which are claimed as their homes,
there is one pre-eminently distinguished. Some miles to the
west of the Lake of Menteith is the village of Aberfoyle,
celebrated by Sir Walter Scott, who says of this locality:
"The lakes and precipices amidst which the Avon Dhu
[<i>Abhainn Dubh</i>; <i>i.e.</i>, Black-Water], or River Forth, has its
birth, are still, according to popular tradition, haunted by the
Elfin people.... An eminently beautiful little conical hill,
near the eastern extremity of the valley of Aberfoil, is supposed
to be one of their peculiar haunts, and is the scene
which awakens in Andrew Fairservice<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> the terror of their
power." The passage in "Rob Roy" to which Scott here
refers is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A beautiful eminence of the most regular round shape, and clothed
with copsewood of hazels, mountain-ash, and dwarf-oak, intermixed with
a few magnificent old trees, which, rising above the underwood, exposed
their forked and bared branches to the silver moonshine, seemed to protect
the sources from which the river sprung. If I could trust the tale
of my companion, which, while professing to disbelieve every word of it,
he told under his breath, and with an air of something like intimidation,
this hill, so regularly formed, so richly verdant, and garlanded with such
a beautiful variety of ancient trees and thriving copsewood, was held by
the neighbourhood to contain, within its unseen caverns, the palaces of
the fairies&mdash;a race of airy beings, who formed an intermediate class
between men and demons, and who, if not positively malignant to
humanity, were yet to be avoided and feared, on account of their
capricious, vindictive, and irritable disposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p>"'They ca' them,' said Mr. Jarvie, in a whisper, '<i>Daoine Schie</i>&mdash;whilk
signifies, as I understand, men of peace; meaning thereby to make
their gudewill. And we may e'en as well ca' them that too, Mr. Osbaldistone,
for there's nae gude in speaking ill o' the laird within his ain bounds.'
But he added presently after, on seeing one or two lights which
twinkled before us, 'It's deceits o' Satan, after a', and I fearna to say it&mdash;for
we are near the manse now, and yonder are the lights in the
clachan of Aberfoil.'"<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To describe this as a "<i>little, conical</i> hill," as Scott does, is
misleading. When viewed transversely, from the opposite
bank of the Blackwater, it has a conical appearance, certainly,
as the gable of a roof has. But when its true length is seen,
as when viewed from the west, this Fairy Knowe of Aberfoyle
reveals itself as of the "hog-back" order, or as was
said of Tomnaheurich, like a "Thames wherry, turned keel
upwards." And as for its height, neither Scott's "little"
nor its local name of "Fairy <i>Knowe</i>" gives anything like a
true idea of its dimensions. How much of this "knowe" is
artificial, or whether <i>any</i> of it is, remains to be discovered.
But if it and Tomnaheurich have truly had the origin that
tradition assigns to them, then they belong to a class of
"hollow hills" which are as much greater than New Grange
("The Brugh of the Boyne") as New Grange is greater than
Maes-how, or Maes-how than the Broch of Coldoch. Such
a mound as Maes-how may be held to represent the ordinary
Pecht's House or Fairy Hillock; a structure which, though
of artificial origin, may be correctly styled a hillock. But
the Brugh of the Boyne is a "hill," rather than a "hillock."
What limits the mound-builders set themselves is not known.
But the people who were capable of the ideas and the labour
implied in such a structure as "the Brugh of the Boyne"
might as well have reared mounds that were two or three
times its size.</p>

<p>This Fairy Knowe is not only known locally by that name,
but also as the Doon,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> or Doon Hill. If that implies that it
was a fortification, the site was perfect. Protected on its
north-eastern side by the river, and on the south-west by its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
own almost precipitous rampart, the Doon of Aberfoyle
stands like a sentinel at what is there called "The Gate of
the Highlands." The little valley which it protects teems
with traditions of the dwarfs who are said to have once dwelt
there, and whose dwellings are yet pointed out. Even yet
the old people have many a tale of how the ruling family of
Graham won their possessions there; and one such tale is
that which has just been spoken of, wherein a Graham (Earl
of Menteith) appears as the overlord of the dwarfs. That
this family, properly <i>de</i> Graeme, traces its origin to those
Anglo-Normans, such as Bruce and his chief nobles, who
were the founders of the Neo-Scottish kingdom, is quite compatible
with the idea that De Graeme's dwarfish labourers
were, historically, Picts; a race distinguished as the allies of
the English and the enemies of Bruce.</p>

<p>Enough has now been said to illustrate what is really the
test of the "realistic" theory of the fairy tales. Tradition
has truly stated, during many generations, that such apparently-natural
hillocks as Maes-how and Coldoch were inhabited by
little people. All archæologists are agreed that many artificial
hillocks are at present standing with their secrets unrevealed.
But if, by following the lead of tradition, we find it a
reasonably safe<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> guide to those primitive habitations, then its
statements must deserve a much fuller and more serious consideration
than they have ever yet received. Either the
"realistic theory" is a vain imagination (as it is believed to
be by those who take the "mythological" view of such
traditions), or else it is something of the very greatest importance;
as others, of whom the present writer is one,
believe it to be. Should this method of interpreting the past
be proved a true one, the results which would flow from its
acceptance would be far-reaching indeed. But tradition has
yet to establish its right to be unquestionably regarded as a
guide. It may be that every chambered mound already
opened had long had its real nature foretold by the voice of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
local tradition. But the surest test of the authenticity of
tradition lies in its future application. It is known to all
archæologists in Western Europe that it is not necessary to go
so far east as Mycenæ to find the chambered mound, with its
dry-stone walls and "Pelasgic" arch. And tradition points
to many a seeming "hillock,"<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and says that it, too, is a
"treasure-house of Atreus." The question to be decided is,
How far is tradition to be trusted? And the answer can be
very easily obtained.</p>

<p>It is manifest that the traditions relating to "the little
people" contain many statements which at the first sight
seem to be irreconcilable with one another. In one aspect,
the dwarf races appear as possessed of a higher culture than
the race or races who were physically their superiors. They
forge swords of "magic" temper, and armour of proof;
beautifully-wrought goblets of gold and silver, silver-mounted
bridles, garments of silk, and personal ornaments of precious
metals and precious stones, are all associated with them. They
are deeply versed in "magic" (a term generally held to
denote the science of the Chaldæan Magi), and this renders
them the teachers of the taller race, in religion, and in many
forms of knowledge. In short, it is only in physical stature
that they are below the latter people: in everything else
they are above them. In another aspect, the positions are
reversed. The dwarfs are the serfs and drudges of the taller
race, to whom they are distinctly inferior in intellectual
capacity. The articles associated with them, such as the
primitive arrow-heads of flint, still spoken of as "elf-shot,"
are all indicative of the rudest savagery. They themselves
are accustomed to go without clothes, which, when offered to
them by their masters, they reject indignantly. As great a
contrast is presented by their physique. In some tales, they
are fair, and beautiful in feature, and yellow-haired; in others
they are swarthy in complexion and hair; and again they
are described as red-, or russet-haired. From such conflicting
evidence what is one to infer?</p>

<p>Two or three solutions of this question may be offered.
One that, as the Icelander Gudmund said of these people,
they were "subject to poverty and wealth," like the members
of any modern nation, which contains in itself the most
violent contrasts. Or, again, that the fairy tales belong to
various epochs, during a long stretch of time, in the course

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
of which those tribes, like any others, underwent marked
modifications. But what is probably the best solution is that
the dwarf races of the past, like those of the present, were of
various types. That as the South African Bushmen, the
dwarfs of the Congo region, and the Ainos of Japan, though
all included among the dwarf races, are really different from
each other in many respects, so the dwarf races of the past
were not one but many. That then, as now, there were
black, yellow and white dwarfs; dissimilar in their history
and characteristics; but all alike in one important respect.
This last explanation, although the two others deserve consideration,
is the one that to the present writer seems the
most important.</p>

<p>To state even a few of the inferences to be drawn from
the acceptance of these explanations, is more than can be
attempted here. It is enough to continue as far as possible
to confine these remarks within the limits already observed;
and to keep specially in view that race which is known to
British history as that of the "Picts." What, then, is the
traditional idea of the outward appearance of these people,
apart from their stature?</p>

<p>Scott's "Rob Roy," as he is described in the Glasgow
prison, is said to have greatly resembled the Picts, as they
are remembered in Northumbrian tradition. And when his
appearance is again referred to in a later chapter (ch. xxxii.),
one point of this resemblance is brought out; where it is
stated that his legs were "covered with a fell of thick, short,
red hair, especially around his knees, which resembled in
this respect, as well as from their sinewy appearance of
extreme strength, the limbs of a red-coloured Highland bull."</p>

<p>It matters little whether the historical "Robert MacGregor
or Campbell," really answered to Scott's various descriptions
of him. <i>Rob Ruadh</i>, or "Red Rob," may no doubt have
been fitly applied to many a native of the British Islands,
descended from the race of the Picts.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> But this excessive
hairiness of skin was one of the most marked characteristics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of the Pechts, and forms indeed one of the most distinct
clues to their ethnological position.</p>

<p>Whatever the man was like himself, however, "Rob Roy's
country" contains, among its other features, that "shoulder of
Ben Venue" which we have seen a former Earl of Menteith is
said to have assigned to the dwarfs, and which is remembered
in local tradition as a great resort of theirs. And a spot
specially known as their gathering-place is called the Coire-nan-Uruisgean,
which is rendered "the Corri, or Den, of the
Wild or <i>Shaggy</i> men."<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Now the same word here held to
represent a "shaggy" man is also a synonym for a "brownie,"<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
and when we regard such a specimen of that class as the
particular "brownie" that was an attendant of the chief of
the Grants, we find her (for this was a <i>ban</i>-sithe, or fairy-<i>woman</i>)
known as "May <i>Mollach</i>," which signifies "hairy
May"; it being asserted by tradition that this May was distinguished
for the hairiness of her arms.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The adjective
<i>molach</i> signifies "hairy,"<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and, among other uses, it is appropriately
given, as a name, to many a shaggy little "Scotch
terrier." But in that part of Armstrong's "Dictionary"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
where this adjective is spelt <i>maildheach</i> and <i>mailgheach</i> (of
which the pronunciation is still <i>mâl'yach</i>), its meaning is
defined as "having large shaggy eyebrows." And this, it
will be seen, is specially a characteristic not only of the
traditional dwarfs, but of a race known to ethnology. But it
is probable that the general meaning of "hirsute" is signified
when the derivative noun <i>mailleachan</i> is used as an equivalent
of <i>brownie</i> or <i>uruisg</i>;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> and that a <i>mailleachan</i> was a "hairy
one." Similarly, a special brownie, known as <i>Pcallaidh an
spùit</i>, or "Peallaidh of the waterfall," once well known "at
those congresses" "in a certain district of the Highlands,"<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
may be Englished into "The Shaggy One of the waterfall."
Thus, although <i>uruisg</i> does not literally mean "a shaggy
man" (as Scott says), yet there is nothing wrong in saying
that <i>Coir-nan-Uruisgean</i>, on Loch Katrine, was "the Den of
the Wild or Shaggy Men"; because various terms and
descriptions applying to those <i>uruisgean</i> show that they
were actually "shaggy men."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>No one had a better opportunity of imbibing the traditional
idea of a brownie than the late Mr. J. F. Campbell; whose
birth and upbringing, combined with his great studies in
later life, gave him every chance of learning the various
Highland traditions regarding the appearance of those
people. And when, during his stay in Lapland, he saw a
certain Lapp "of the old school," he speaks of him thus:&mdash;"He
was an old fellow with long, tangled elf-locks and a
scanty beard, dressed in a deerskin shirt full of holes, and
exceedingly mangy, for the hair had been worn off in patches
all over. He realized my idea of a seedy Brownie, a grua-gach
[another synonym] with long hair on his head; an old
wrinkled face, and his body covered with hair."<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
it is not to be understood that the <i>Lapp</i>'s body was "covered
with hair." But the deerskin shirt, worn with the hair outwards,
was one of the things that helped out the "brownie"
appearance of the man; for Mr. Campbell's traditional
brownie had <i>his</i> body covered with hair, like the other
"shaggy men" we have just been speaking of. Again, the
traditional <i>brollachan</i> or <i>fuath</i> of Sutherland is described as
"rough and hairy."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Mr. Campbell also points out that the
<i>glashan</i> of the Isle of Man<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> was the same as those "shaggy
men" of the Scotch Highlands. "He wore no clothes, and
was hairy; and, according to Train's history, Phynoddepee,
which means something hairy, was frightened away by a
gift of clothes,&mdash;exactly as the Skipness long-haired Grua-gach
was frightened away by the offer of a coat and a cap.
The Manks brownie and the Argyllshire one each repeated a
rhyme over the clothes; but the rhymes are not the same,
though they amount to the same thing."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> In a certain story of
South-Western Scotland, a brownie is described as a naked,
hairy man; and in a Scotch "chap-book" of the eighteenth
century, an old woman is made to state that the brownies
are "a' rough but the mouth," and that they "seek nae
claes" (do not wish any clothes).<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The dwarfs of Northumbrian
tradition, whether spoken of by that name or as "Picts,"
are hairy; and, as just mentioned, the Isle of Man contains
similar evidence. The same thing is recorded in Wales. In
his "British Goblins," Mr. Wirt Sikes not only describes
the <i>coblynau</i> as hairy of skin, but he cites the well-known
account of a sixteenth-century race of "Red Fairies" who
"lived in dens in the ground," and bore several other resemblances
to the Picts of Scotland. These "Red Fairies" have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
also been recently cited by Mr. G. L. Gomme, in the course
of an article which points out the survival of savage customs
and savage people, within the British Islands, during recent
centuries.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> The "Red Fairies" inhabited a certain part of
Merionethshire, where it is said that people inheriting some
of their blood are still pointed out. They are remembered
as a race of much-dreaded marauders, their depredations
being carried on in the night time, "and scythes were fixed
in the chimneys of the nearest houses, to prevent the nocturnal
descent of these plundering ruffians." The writer
whose words have just been quoted, contributed an account
of these people to the <i>Scots Magazine</i> of 1823,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and he states
in this connection, that "scythes were to be seen in the chimney
of a neighbouring farm-house about thirty years ago,
but they have been since removed." After referring to their
various characteristics, the same writer goes on:&mdash;"It appears
that the enormities of the Gwylliaid Cochion Mowddwy [the
Red Fairies, or Banditti,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> of Mowddwy] had arrived at such
a pitch as to render necessary the interposition of the most
prompt and vigorous measures. To this end, a commission
was granted to John Wynne ab Meredith, of Gwedir, and
Lewis Owen, one of the Barons of the Welsh Exchequer, and
Vice-Chamberlain of North Wales. These gentlemen raised
a body of men, and, on Christmas Eve, 1554, succeeded in
securing, after considerable resistance, nearly a hundred of
the robbers, on whom they inflicted chastisement the most
summary and effectual, hanging them on the spot, and, as
their commission authorized, without any previous trial."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>A similar race to these "fairies" of Merionethshire seems
to be suggested by the "gubbings" or "gubbins" of Dartmoor.
Those people are described by Fuller, in his "Worthies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of England," published in 1662. Readers of Kingsley's
"Westward Ho!" will remember "how Salvation Yeo slew
the King of the Gubbings," and the description given at that
place. Mr. R. D. Blackmore seems also to have had the
same race in view in his "Maid of Sker"; although that
novel is placed in the eighteenth century. "Cannibal Jack,"
or "Jack Wildman," the most civilized of those Devon
savages, is made to state:&mdash;"I was one of a race of naked
people, living in holes of the earth at a place we did not
know the name of. I now know that it was Nympton in
Devonshire." As to the origin of the term "gubbing," Fuller
confesses himself ignorant.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> But those Devonshire gubbings
were, like the Red Fairies of Wales and the Picts of Scotland,
underground people, or earth-dwellers. It does not
seem to be stated anywhere that the "gubbings" were hairy
of skin; but both in Devon and in Cornwall the underground
people otherwise designated are so described.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Altogether
the savage "gubbins" of Dartmoor, as described by Kingsley
and others, seem to be practically the same people as the
cave-dwelling "pixies" of Dartmoor, whose occasional raids
into the town of Tavistock are still remembered in local folk-lore.</p>

<p>This nakedness of the brownie is referred to again and
again in the folk-lore of Scotland. The general belief seems
to be that when he was offered clothes in return for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
labour he left the place where he had been working, in high
dudgeon. Other accounts indicate that he accepted the
clothes without demur. But the indications that the "shaggy
men" were naked men, are numerous. And when Mr.
Campbell says that "the Highlanders distinguish between
the water and land or <i>dressed</i> fairies,"<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> he clearly infers that
one section of the little people was remarkable for the entire
absence of dress. Indeed, it was this peculiarity that, as the
various stories show, offended the delicacy of the womenfolk
at those farms where "brownies" worked, and so led to the
offer of clothing, by way of wages. And, of course, the
reason why their special hairiness of skin is so well remembered
is because their own shaggy coats formed all their
clothing; and probably answered the purpose very well.</p>

<p>Outside the British Islands there are plenty of similar
traditional accounts. The Scandinavian trolls, or dwarfs, of
the Eddas were hairy; and so was the German dwarf. The
latter has one name, that of <i>Bilwiz</i>, said to be derived from
a word denoting matted hair; and we are told that "the
Bilwiz shoots like the elf, and has shaggy or matted hair."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
And he, there can be little doubt, is the same as the "little
forest-man." For the same authority<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> states that "little
forest-men, who have long worked in a mill, have been scared
away by the miller's men leaving clothes and shoes for them."
And if these nude and hairy "little people" were not of the
same race as the hirsute brownies of Scotland, they were
remarkably like them in several striking characteristics. With
them also may be compared the shaggy dwarfs remembered
in Brittany under the name of <i>viltansou</i>, who are doubtless
the same as the long-bearded <i>barbao</i> of the same province.
(<i>See</i> M. Sébillot's list of such names in the "Revue des
Traditions Populaires," Feb. 1890, pp. 101-104.)</p>

<p>The German traditional idea of the mound-dwelling, metal-working
dwarf people, is nowhere more perfectly given than
in the etching which is here reproduced, and which is the
work of a German engraver. It forms the base of a title-page,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
executed about thirty years ago,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> consecrated to the
memory of the great Barbarossa, whose figure occupies the
centre of the title-page, and whose achievements are otherwise
symbolically indicated. It is understood to be a facsimile of
the base of Barbarossa's statue. The little gnomes, then,
underneath him, are clearly meant to represent his companions
in the "berg" where he and they are popularly
believed to be still living&mdash;whether that be the Thuringian
Kyffhäuser, or the Untersberg, near Salzburg. And the hairiness
of skin, so characteristic of the Scottish <i>brownie</i> or <i>pecht</i>,
is equally marked in this case. The term "shaggy men"
could be applied to them with very great appropriateness.
And if the artist has not made them as destitute of clothing
as the "brownies" and "forest-men" are said to have been,
yet what they do wear only serves to remind one of the red-cap
of the traditional Lincolnshire dwarfs, and others of the same
class, and of the "apron" so often mentioned in connection
with the dwarfish builders of England and Scotland. It is
not to be supposed that this picture represents in every detail
the dwarfs of German or other traditions, nor is it to be supposed
that any single account gives an absolutely correct
idea of the appearance of those primitive races, but this will
be generally recognized as being, on the whole,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> a wonderfully
good representation of the dwarfs of German folk-lore.</p>

<p>But this characteristic of the dwarfs of Scottish tradition
and of the "Picts" of history does not tend to show that such
people were <i>identical</i> with the modern Lapps. Nor, indeed,
is this to be looked for.</p>

<p class="caption">THE DWARFS OF GERMAN FOLK LORE.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<p>A race which was in its prime two
thousand years ago may have many points in common with
one or another of the modern races (presumably its own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
descendants, in some measure); but absolute identity of type
can hardly be expected, if one considers the crossing, re-crossing,
and in some cases almost the extermination of the
various races of Europe during that period. At any rate,
this marked hairiness of skin, attributed to the Pict, or Pecht,
or dwarf, is not a Mongoloid characteristic. It is certainly
not <i>Mongolian</i>; and although some divisions of the Mongoloid
group&mdash;such as the Eskimos of Labrador&mdash;are described
as wearing moustaches and beards, this fact, even if it be
not exceptional, goes a very little way towards suggesting an
actually hirsute ancestor. Had there been less doubt about
the matter, one might have supposed that the hairy skin-garments
of those Northern races had been erroneously
assumed in the traditional tales to be the natural skin of
their owners; and, indeed, the pictures of the modern Eskimos
in their winter dress of skins with the hair outside, gives
quite the appearance of a race of hairy little men. But the
nudity of the historical Picts, and certain sections of the
traditional dwarfs, or brownies, is beyond all doubt. To the
Latin writers, as to the housewives of legendary history, this
was equally an unmistakable and objectionable fact.</p>

<p>There is, however, an existing race that offers itself as akin
to those traditional dwarfs in this respect, as well as in some
others; although the modern Lapps, in several of their
characteristics, also suggest that a not insignificant line of
their ancestry is traceable to the same origin. The race referred
to is that of the "hairy Kuriles," or Ainos of Japan;
included by ethnologists among the modern dwarf races.</p>

<p>"Twelve hundred years ago," says Mr. E. B. Tylor, "a
Chinese historian stated that 'on the eastern frontiers of the
land of Japan there is a barrier of great mountains, beyond
which is the land of the Hairy Men.' These were the Aino, so
named from the word in their own language signifying 'man.'
Over most of the country of these rude and helpless indigenes
the Japanese have long since spread, only a dwindling
remnant of them still inhabiting the island of Yezo. Since
the early days when a couple of them were sent as curiosities
to the Emperor of China, their uncouth looks and habits have
made them objects of interest to more civilized nations."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Of their own traditions, another writer states:&mdash;"To them
the past is dead, yet, like other conquered and despised races,
they cling to the idea that in some far-off age they were a
great nation. They have no traditions of internecine strife,
and the art of war seems to have been lost long ago. I
asked Benri [a chief] about this matter, and he says that
formerly Ainos fought with spears and knives, as well as with
bows and arrows, but that Yoshitsuné, their hero god, forbade
war for ever, and since then the two-edged spear, with a shaft
nine feet long, has only been used in hunting bears."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Yoshitsuné,
it may be explained, is stated (<i>op. cit. infra</i>, II. 94,
<i>note</i>) to have been the brother of a Japanese general of the
twelfth century, famous for his victories over "barbarians."
This tradition, therefore, if accepted without reserve, would
place the conquest of the Ainos by the Japanese, with the
consequent disarming of the former, somewhere about the
twelfth century. And the scene of this struggle may be
placed south and west of their present home. "The inference
from records and local names, worked out with great
care by Professor Chamberlain, is 'that the Ainos were truly
the predecessors of the Japanese all over the Archipelago.
The dawn of history shows them to us living far to the south
and west of their present haunts; and ever since then, century
by century, we see them retreating eastwards and northwards,
as steadily as the American Indian has retreated westwards
under the pressure of the colonists from Europe.'"<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>"As is well known, the hairiness of the Ainos marks them
sharply off from the smooth-faced Japanese. No one can
look at photographs of Ainos without admitting that the
often-repeated comparison of them to bearded Russian peasants
is much to the purpose. The likeness is much strengthened
by the bold quasi-European features of the Aino contrasting
extremely with the Japanese type of face."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> "The
expression of the face and the manner of showing courtesy are
European rather than Asiatic," says Miss Bird, who has lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
among these people; and she again remarks, on a later page,
"I am more and more convinced that the expression of their
faces is European."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>"The men are about the middle height,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> broad-chested,
broad-shouldered, 'thick-set,' very strongly built, the arms
and legs short, thick, and muscular, the hands and feet
large. The bodies, and specially the limbs, of many are
covered with short bristly hair. I have seen two boys whose
backs are covered with fur as fine and soft as that of a cat."
"The 'ferocious savagery' of the appearance of the men is
produced by a profusion of thick, soft, black hair, divided in
the middle, and falling in heavy masses nearly to the shoulders.
Out of doors it is kept from falling over the face by
a fillet round the brow. The beards are equally profuse,
quite magnificent, and generally wavy, and in the case of the
old men they give a truly patriarchal and venerable aspect, in
spite of the yellow tinge produced by smoke and want of
cleanliness." "The beard, moustache, and eyebrows are very
thick and full." "At a deep river called the Nopkobets,"
says the same writer, "we were ferried by an Aino completely
covered with hair, which on his shoulders was wavy like that
of a retriever, and rendered clothing quite needless either for
covering or warmth. A wavy, black beard rippled nearly to
his waist over his furry chest, and, with his black locks hanging
in masses over his shoulders, he would have looked a
thorough savage had it not been for the exceeding sweetness
of his smile and eyes. The Volcano Bay Ainos are far more
hairy than the mountain Ainos." Again&mdash;"These Lebungé
Ainos differ considerably from those of the eastern villages,
and I have again to notice the decided sound or <i>click</i> of the
<i>ts</i> at the beginning of many words. Their skins are as
swarthy as those of Bedaween, their foreheads comparatively
low [the Aino forehead being in general remarkably high],
their eyes far more deeply set, their stature lower, their hair
yet more abundant, the look of wistful melancholy more
marked, and two, who were unclothed for hard work in
fashioning a canoe, were almost entirely covered with short,
black hair, specially thick on the shoulders and back, and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
completely concealing the skin as to reconcile one to the
lack of clothing. I noticed an enormous breadth of chest,
and a great development of the muscles of the arms and legs.
All these Ainos shave their hair off for two inches above
their brows, only allowing it there to attain the length of an
inch." "Their voices were the lowest and most musical that
I have heard, incongruous sounds to proceed from such hairy,
powerful-looking men.... These, like other Ainos, utter a
short, screeching sound when they are not pleased, and then
one recognizes the savage."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>The picture of "An Aino Patriarch," which is here reproduced
from Miss Bird's book,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> does not enable one to fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
realize the purest type of Aino; partly owing to the fact
that the figure is clothed, and partly because this man appears
to have belonged to one of the more modified sections of the
race. However, as he is, he is not a very bad representative
of the bearded dwarf, with disproportionately large head, so
familiar in tradition; and that he is one of the race of
"shaggy men," we know without fuller evidence. His beard
does not fall down to his waist, like that of his kinsman who
figures as a ferryman in the foregoing quotation; but the
heavy moustache and beard, and the shaggy eyebrows,
strongly characterize this living race as well as the legendary
dwarfs. The latter are again and again referred to as "little
old<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> men, with long beards"; and, indeed, in one of Grimm's
tales ("Snow-White and Rosy-Red"), a dwarf has a beard
so long that it gets caught in the trunk of a tree that has
been felled. The artist who drew the picture of Barbarossa's
dwarfs has not forgotten this marked traditional feature.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
Such dwarfs are all remembered as possessed of supernatural
powers, enchanters, magicians, etc.; and, conversely, the
magicians (Gaelic <i>druidhean</i>) of early Britain are famous for
their flowing beards.</p>

<p>An earlier Aino than those pictured by Miss Bird is that
which Baron Nordenskiöld gives in his "Voyage of the Vega."
With regard to it he says:&mdash;"The drawing is taken from a
Japanese work, whose title, when translated, runs thus&mdash;'A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Journey to the North Part of Japan (Yezo), 1804.'"</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width:295px;"><a name="i203" id="i203"></a>
<img src="images/i_203.png" width="298" height="185" alt="AINO OF 1804." title="" />
<p class="caption"> AINO OF 1804.</p>
</div>


<p>In this
picture, which is here annexed, there are several notable
features. Not only has this Aino of 1804 the short, thick-set
figure, heavy beard, and "bull-necked" appearance of
the traditional dwarf, but he is represented as driving a reindeer.
Now, this seems at once to connect the Aino with the
Samoyed and the Lapp. For, although the reindeer is hunted
by the Eskimos of North America, these people have never
domesticated it. Moreover, the Aino is standing on runners,
which appear to be very similar to the "skies" of the Lapps.
Both of these details are distinctive of the Aino and the
Lapp (for although the "skies" are used to the south of
Finmark, they are peculiarly associated with the Lapps,
who excel all other Norwegians in this accomplishment).
"The deer-hide moccasins which they wear for winter
hunting"<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> form another link of custom uniting the Aino
to the Lapp and the Eskimo. So also does the harpoon
and line which the Ainos use, or used, in seal-hunting,
as is evidenced by two of Professor Chamberlain's tales.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
Thus, although the Aino differs very much, in some respects,
from the Eskimo type of man, he cannot be regarded as
wholly different from him.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> As regards stature, the two are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
much alike; and several usages have just been cited that
distinctly unite the two. If one might discriminate, it might
be said that the relationship extends westward from the
Kurile Islands, rather than eastward into North America.
That the Aino should remind travellers so strongly of certain
European types, is very suggestive of a line of ancestry
which is shared by Europeans. Indeed, those hirsute qualities
which distinguish the Aino exist, though in much more
modified forms (even in the instance of Russian peasants)
among the people of Europe; sufficiently to mark off the
average European from the races of other continents. That
one line of European ancestry should lead back to a race
strongly resembling the modern Ainos is therefore a belief
that the outward appearance of the modern European rather
tends to strengthen.</p>

<p>In speculating upon the appearance of the European
"cave-man" of the past, a writer in the "Cornhill"<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> (? Mr.
Grant Allen) states as his opinion that "at any rate, he was
distinctly hairy, like the Ainos, or aborigines of Japan, in
our own day, of whom Miss Isabella Bird has drawn so startling
and sensational a picture." Again, after remarking that
those cave-men "seem to have been in most essential particulars
almost as advanced as the modern Eskimo, with whom
Professor Dawkins conjecturally identifies them," Mr. Grant
Allen goes on to say<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>&mdash;"But if Professor Dawkins means us
to understand that the cave-men were physically developed
to the same extent as the Eskimo, it is necessary to accept
his conclusion with great caution. It does not follow because
the Eskimo are the nearest modern parallels of the cave-men,
that the cave-men therefore resembled them closely in appearance.
Several of the sketches of cave-men, cut by themselves
on horn and bone, certainly show (it seems to me) that they
were covered with hair over the whole body: and the hunter
in the antler from the Duruthy cave has a long pointed beard
and high crest of hair on the poll utterly unlike the Eskimo
type." And although Mr. Allen admits, on a later page, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
"it is possible enough that the cave-man was the direct
ancestor of the Eskimo," yet he qualifies this admission by
observing that "it does not at all follow that in physical
appearance the earlier cave-men were the equals of the
Eskimo, or, indeed, that the Eskimo are any more nearly
related to them than ourselves."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Of course, it is understood by the writer of these lines
that the remarks upon "cave-men" just quoted, were made
in the belief that all those cave-men lived at a period immensely
removed from the present time. But the classification
of man's history into so many "periods" and "ages" is
admittedly vague. And the recognition of a visible relationship
between certain races of living men, and those others
who are called "pre-historic," is practically a recognition of
the possibility that the not very remote ancestors of such
races may be remembered with comparative clearness in the
popular memory of those who are mainly descended from
races of a higher type.</p>

<p>That this is really the case is what all the evidence adduced
in these pages tends to show. And, indeed, the actual picture
of a living Aino of about ninety years ago, reproduced above,
is by no means remarkably different from the traditional
figure given below, which represents the magician, or "good
fairy," as he appears in the popular memory, when arriving
from the far North, on Yule Eve, laden with gifts for his
vassals. The annexed woodcut gives the idea of "Santa
Claus," as he figures in the American fancy, and that, as the
title given to him indicates, is really the German idea. The
German idea, then, of this good magician is that he is a
thick-set, bearded, little man, whose heavy furs denote that
his home lies in the North, and whose reindeer team, harnessed
to the sledge in which he has travelled, indicates that,
like the Lapp and the Aino, he not only lives in a country
where reindeer abound, but he has learned to tame them and
make them serve his purposes. In this traditional figure
one seems to see the type of a race that was even more like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the Aino than the Lapp, or the Eskimo, although closely
connected in various ways with all of these. Neither this
figure, nor those of Barbarossa's dwarfs, need be regarded as
absolutely correct; but in both we see that the popular
memory is wonderfully faithful to what appears to be the
actual truth.</p>

<p>The existence in Europe of such a race, neither Lapp nor
Aino, though akin to both, seems indicated by as recent a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
geographer as Olaus Magnus. In his map of Northern
Europe,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> the extreme north of Norway is neither "Lappia"
nor "Finmarchia" (although both of these are shown), but
a country which borders them on the north, and which he
calls "Scricfinnia." This name appears to have been otherwise
spelt "Scritfinnia" or "Scridfinnia," and one writer
states that its people, the "Scridfinni," "derived their name
from the word <i>skrida</i>, which in the Danish and Swedish
languages means to slide."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> This refers to the snow-skates,
or "skies," which they are described as using, but as Olaus
Magnus pictures the people of "Lappia" as also using
"skies," it does not seem that that usage was distinctive of
the "Scridfinni." But what appears to be of much more
importance than this etymological point is the fact that the
gloss which Olaus Magnus places opposite "Scricfinnia" is
to this effect:&mdash;"<i>Hic habitant Pÿgmei Vulgo Screlinger dicti</i>."
The earliest cited mention of the <i>Screlinger</i>, or <i>Skrælings</i>,
occurs in the accounts of the Norse visits to North America,
at the end of the tenth century; and the people thus referred
to are generally identified with the Esquimaux. "The Northmen
were used to call the Esquimaux Skrælings, a term of
contempt, meaning, says Crantz, 'chips, parings, <i>i.e.</i>, dwarfs.'"
And the North American Skrælings of the tenth century,
who are described as paddling about in skin-canoes, "skimming
the surface of the water in their swift flight," are quite
obviously either of the same race as the modern Eskimos,
or else closely allied to them.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> In the course of eight or nine
centuries, the "Skrælings" may have become modified to
some extent; and, indeed, modern travellers<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> are wonderfully
unanimous in remarking upon the effect that nineteenth-century
intermixture has had upon Asiatic and Greenland
Eskimos, and upon the Ainos. But whatever the exact
appearance of the tenth-century "Skræling," the map of
Olaus Magnus denotes that, five or six centuries later, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
extreme north of Norway was inhabited by a race of
"Skrælings"; and that these people were the same as the
"pygmies" of classical writers. It has already been pointed
out<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> that the Greenland "Skrælings" were also spoken of
as "goblins," and this again shows that that American type,
whether most akin to the modern Eskimo or to the Aino,
was not a <i>new</i> type to those European explorers,&mdash;whose
legendary history was already teeming with stories of encounters
with "goblins."<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may have been the ethnical position of the tenth-century
"Skræling" of America, this sixteenth-century
map of North Europe certainly signifies that the "pigmies,"
"Screlings," or "Scric-Finns" of the extreme north of Scandinavia
were neither "Finns" nor "Lapps," but a race that
ultimately yielded place to these. There are similar indications
in the extreme north of Asia. The Chukches of Siberia undoubtedly
connect the Lapp in the west with the Eskimo in
the east. But these Chukches have traditions of a race
called <i>Onkilon</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "sea-folk," whom the Chukches, moving
northward, displaced or annihilated. "Tradition relates that
upwards of two hundred years ago these Onkilon occupied
the whole of the Chukch coast, from Cape Chelagskoj to
Behring's Straits; and indeed we still find along the whole
of this stretch remains of their earth-huts, which must have
been very unlike the present dwellings of the Chukches;
they have the form of small mounds, are half sunk in the
ground and closed above with whale ribs, which are covered
with a thick layer of earth." Baron Nordenskiöld, who is
here quoting Wrangel's "Reise" (1825), gives himself a
representation of one of those Onkilon earth-dwellings, seen
by him at Cape North.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> In these now-extinct "Onkilon,"
then, we have a race of people who, like the Finns and sea-trows
of Shetland, were famed as "sea-folk," and who at the
same time were underground-people or mound-dwellers.</p>

<p>There is yet another characteristic of the modern Aino
which suggests the dwarf of the British Isles. "Mention
must also be made of an anatomical peculiarity of the Aino
skeleton, consisting of a remarkable flattening of the arm-
and leg-bones."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> This peculiarity, which is known scientifically
as "platycnemism," forms a part of Herr von Siebold's
"Ethnologische Studien über die Aino, auf der Insel Yesso."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
Much may be learned with regard to platycnemism in a
paper "On the Discovery of Platycnemic Men in Denbighshire,"<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
by Professors Busk and Boyd Dawkins; and the
subject of platycnemism generally has been very fully discussed
in Dr. L. Manouvrier's "Mémoire sur la Platycnémie."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
The question is full of interest; but what we are here concerned
with is the fact that, characterizing the dwarfish, hairy
Ainos of the nineteenth century, this flattening of the leg-bones
is also associated with the dwarfs of Britain. Those
cave-dwelling, "platycnemic men" of Denbighshire, though
not actually dwarfs, were of no greater height on an average
than five feet, or a trifle over. Again, the skeletons found in
the underground dwellings of Wiltshire, which have been so
closely studied by General Pitt-Rivers, exhibit marked platycnemism
in several instances, and of these the average height
was 5 ft., 1<sup>.3</sup> (among eleven males), and (among three females)
4 ft., 10.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> In Wigtownshire, also, the bones of certain cave-men
have yielded at least one tibia which has been pronounced
to be "highly platycnemic." The locality where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
these remains were found has been spoken of on a previous
page,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> as a locality famed as the last refuge of the "Pechts,"
and, at the same time, as a home of the "fairies." These
are a few special instances; but if once we recognize the
probability that platycnemism was specially a characteristic
of "the little people," then there will be small difficulty in
accepting as true the forecast with which Mr. Boyd Dawkins
concludes his remarks in the paper above mentioned:&mdash;"I
have not the slightest doubt that platycnemism will be recognized
in remains from chambered tombs in many parts of
Britain, and that eventually the men found in Denbighshire
will be proved to belong to a race that spread over Britain
and Ireland, and a large area on the Continent."</p>

<p>The effect of this flattened tibia or leg-bone is to give to
the "platycnemic man" an unusual degree of agility. Thus
one reads that the Ainos who drew Miss Bird's <i>kuruma</i> raced
"for a considerable distance" with some mounted Japanese,
drawing the <i>kuruma</i>, of course, at the same time. Similarly,
the mountain-ponies of the Picts "could hardly excel the
speed of the troops on foot."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> The traditional accounts of
the "Fians" have much to say of their marvellous swiftness
of foot. The same thing is noted of the Dartmoor <i>gubbins</i>
of the sixteenth century: "Such their fleetness, they will
outrun many horses."<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> And the earth-dwelling "Red
Fairies" of Merionethshire "were also remarkable for their
swiftness and agility."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> There is a Scotch story of a brownie
who successfully "herded" a hare; and the lightness of foot
of the fairy in general is proverbial. From all these references,
then, there is every reason for believing that the little
people were "platycnemic men."</p>

<p>This identification of the traditional dwarfs with the Ainos
on the one hand and the Eskimos on the other, amounts to
an assumption that the dwarfs were not only hirsute like the
first of these, and mound-dwellers like the second, but also
that, like the extinct <i>Onkilon</i> of Siberia, they were in a distinct
sense "sea-folk." In other words, that, while showing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
a strong <i>affinity</i> with the two modern types chiefly referred
to in these pages, they were nevertheless not <i>identical</i> with
either. That they were the ancestors of both seems probable,
bequeathing to each division some of the qualities and
customs of the original stock; which might be described as
Aino-Eskimo.</p>

<p>So far as tradition goes, there is every indication that the
hairy dwarf was of a sea-faring race. The Gaelic <i>ur-uisg</i>
was rightly called a "wild or <i>shaggy</i> man" by Sir Walter
Scott, but literally he was a "<i>water</i>-man"; which term has
many equivalents, such as wasser-man, mer-man, and others.
The Guernsey "King of the <i>Auxcriniers</i>" previously mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
may also denote this identification of the <i>zee-woner</i>
with the "shaggy man"; unless the name <i>auxcriniers</i> bears
a less obvious meaning than it appears to do. But no better
illustration of this union can be found than the historical Picts.
Tradition has told us of their shaggy skins, and the "small
boats" which they used. And both of these are indicated
by the sixth-century Gildas, in his account of the inroads of
the Picts and Scots, after the withdrawal of the Romans,
where he says:&mdash;"Itaque illis ad sua revertentibus, emergunt
certatim de curicis, quibus sunt trans Cichicam<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> vallem vecti,
quasi in alto Titane incalescenteque caumate de arctissimis
foraminum cavernulis fusci vermiculorum cunei, tetri Scotorum
Pictorumque greges, moribus ex parte dissidentes, sed
una eademque sanguinis fundendi aviditate concordes, furci-ferosque
magis vultus pilis, quam corporum pudenda, pudendisque
proxima, vestibus tegentes."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>There is complete agreement among the commentators of
Gildas that the word "curicis" is a Latinized form of the
Celtic <i>curach</i>, a skin-boat. And the expression "de arctissimis
foraminum cavernulis" is singularly confirmative of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
assumption that the variety of skin-boat denoted was the
narrow kayak with its small round man-hole, and covered
"hold," out of which the invading Pict "eagerly emerged"
in his haste to attack the Romanized and civilized people in
the neighbourhood of the Wall. The reference to their
appearance generally is, moreover, very much like the terms
used by the Norse writers in speaking of the tenth-century
"Skrælings."</p>

<p>That the historical Picts were as "amphibious" as any
other "sea-folk" of the kind here discussed, is further testified
by such a statement as this:&mdash;"They passed their days in
the water, swimming in the northern estuaries, or wading
with the stream as high as the waist. Dion Cassius adds,
with his characteristic vivacity, that they would hide in the
mud for days together, with nothing but their heads out of
the water."<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Although the custom of hiding from an enemy
in the fashion just described was practised quite recently by
the "bog-trotters" in Ireland (see <i>Rokeby</i>, Note 2 R), it is
doubtful how far these statements ought to be accepted
literally. But at least they point to the Picts as a race as
much at home on sea as on land; and the reference to their
"wading" in the water waist-high is again suggestive of the
traditional mer-man or Triton, and the actual Eskimo (as he
appears at a distance).</p>

<p>Thus, although the dwarfs of Shetland tradition are
separately remembered as "sea-trows" and "hill-trows"
(otherwise "hill-people," or "högfolk"), it seems quite evident
that these two names simply refer to two different
aspects of one race. The memory of them, in connection
with their homes in chambered mounds ("hows," "högs," or
"pechts' houses"), has gradually become dissociated from
the memory of them in their character of sea-rovers, when in
their swift "sea-skins" they darted after and easily overtook
the heavy wooden boats used by the rival race. Nevertheless,
although popular tradition, in thus remembering them,
has almost transformed them into an actually amphibious race,
it yet asserts that these seafaring "Finns" "are reckoned
among the Trows."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Such are some of the deductions to be drawn from a comparison
of traditional accounts with those of history, taken
in connection with the ethnical features and the customs of
certain races of people. There are many more inferences
which could be made, but these may reasonably be deferred
until the true value of tradition has been tested. The way in
which this can be done has been pointed out in the foregoing
pages. Should tradition prove itself reliable as a guide to
the dwellings of "the little people," then <i>all</i> its statements
regarding them will merit the closest consideration.</p>

<h3>THE BRUGH OF THE BOYNE, NEW GRANGE.</h3>

<p>The descriptions of the New Grange mound given by Llhwyd and
Molyneux are of much importance, since they both belong to about
the beginning of the eighteenth century; and as they are not very
accessible to the general reader they may suitably be quoted
here. The two writers do not altogether agree in their account of
the appearance of the chamber, and their theories as to its origin
are certainly different; but whatever may be the value of the latter,
there can be no doubt that descriptions which were made at a time
when the interior of this mound was fresher by two centuries than
it now is have a value that is lacking in the descriptions of modern
writers, however accurate. The following is</p>

<p>"<i>An Account of a large Cave nigh</i> Drogheda, <i>by Mr.</i> Edward
Llhwyd."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>"The most remarkable curiosity we saw by the way, was a stately
mount at a place called <i>New Grange</i> near <i>Drogheda</i>; having a
number of huge stones pitch'd on end round about it, and a single
one on the top. The gentleman of the village (one Mr. <i>Charles
Campbel</i>) observing that under the green turf this mount was
wholly composed of stones, and having occasion for some, employ'd
his servants to carry off a considerable parcel of them; till they
came at last to a very broad flat stone, rudely carv'd, and placed
edgewise at the bottom of the mount. This they discovered to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the door of the cave,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> which had a long entry leading into it. At
the first entering, we were forced to creep; but still as we went on,
the pillars on each side of us were higher and higher; and coming
into the cave, we found it about twenty foot high. In this cave, on
each hand of us, was a cell or apartment, and another went on
straight forward opposite to the entry. In those on each hand was a
very broad, shallow bason of stone, situated at the edge. The bason
in the right hand apartment stood in another; that on the left hand
was single; and in the apartment straight forward there was none
at all. We observed that water dropt into the right hand bason,
tho' it had rain'd but little in many days; and suspected that the
lower bason was intended to preserve the superfluous liquor of the
upper, (whether this water were sacred, or whether it was for blood
in sacrifice) that none might come to the ground. The great pillars
round this cave, supporting the mount, were not at all hewn or
wrought; but were such rude stones as those of <i>Abury</i> in <i>Wiltshire</i>,
and rather more rude than those of <i>Stonehenge</i>: but those about
the basons, and some elsewhere, had such barbarous sculpture
(<i>viz.</i>, spiral like a snake, but without distinction of head and tail)
as the forementioned stone at the entry of the cave. There was
no flagging nor floor to this entry nor cave; but any sort of
loose stones everywhere under feet. They found several bones in
the cave, and part of a stag's (or else elk's) head, and some other
things, which I omit, because the labourers differed in their
account of them. A gold coin of the emperor <i>Valentinian</i>, being
found near the top of this mount, might bespeak it <i>Roman</i>; but
that the rude carving at the entry and in the cave seems to denote
it a barbarous monument. So, the coin proving it ancienter than
any invasion of the <i>Ostmens</i> (<i>sic</i>) or <i>Danes</i>, and the carving and
rude sculpture, barbarous; it should follow, that it was some place
of sacrifice or burial of the ancient <i>Irish</i>."</p>

<p>From the account given by Dr. Thomas Molyneux,<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> the following
extracts may be taken:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis situated in the county of <i>Meath</i> and barony of <i>Slaine</i>,
within four miles of the town of <i>Drogheda</i>; from its largeness and
make, from the time and labour it must needs have cost to erect so
great a pile, we may easily gather 'twas raised in honour of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
mighty prince, or person of the greatest power and dignity in his
time. I have not heard of any thing of this kind that equals it in
<i>Ireland</i>: 'tis a thousand foot in the circumference at the bottom,
and round the flat surface at the top measures three hundred foot,
it rises in the perpendicular about a hundred and fifty foot; and
is seated so advantageously upon a rising ground, that it is seen
from all parts round at a vast distance, and from its top yields a
delightful prospect of all the adjacent country.</p>

<p>Round the bottom of the mount, at some distance from it, are
raised in a circular order, huge unwrought stones, rudely expressing
pyramids, fixt with their basis in the ground, now at unequal
distances, because some I suppose have been removed in length of
time, and others faln down; neither do they answer one another
in height, some being eleven, others not four foot high;...</p>

<p>The mount it self is composed of small round paving stones,
heapt together so as to form a pyramid, within whose center lies a
cave that's somewhat round in figure: to this you can only pass
through a narrow hole placed on the north<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> side of the mount, so
strait, it does allow an entrance but to one man, and that when on
his hands and feet: it seems they industriously contrived this hole
should lye concealed, for 'twas but lately discovered, and that by
accident in removing part of the stones to make a pavement in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This strait entrance leads into a narrow gallery of 80 foot in
length, 3 foot wide, gradually rising in height, still the further it
advances from the narrow passage where you enter, there 'tis about
4 foot high, and from thence rises slowly till it is 10 foot in height:
the differing heights in this gallery at several distances from the
first entrance, must be occasioned by the passage suiting its figure
to the outward conical shape of the mount, which obliged the contriver
to make the gallery lower as it was nearer the outside of the
pyramid, but the farther it advanced from thence allowed him still
to raise its height more, and most of all about the middle of the
mount.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The walls or sides of this strait gallery are made of large
flag stones set broad-ways with their edges close to one another,
not hewn or shaped by any tool, but rude and natural, as when
they were at first dug from the quarry; they differ in their sizes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
as the several heights of the gallery require, the top of which is
covered over with the same flag stones laid along; some of those
in the covering measure full nineteen foot in length.</p>

<p>The furthest end of this long narrow passage lets you into the
dark hollow cave, of an irregular figure, nineteen or twenty foot
high, and in the middle about ten foot broad. As you enter the
vault, on each hand you have a hollow cell or nich, taken out of
the sides of the cave, and a third straight before you, these three
cells each are about five foot every way, and ten in height: the walls
round the circumference of the cave, and of these side apartments
are composed like those of the long gallery, of huge, mighty flag
stones set end-ways in the ground, of seven or eight foot high; these
upright stones support other broad stones that lay along or horizontally,
jetting their ends beyond the upright stones; and over these
again are placed another order of flat stones in the same level posture,
advancing still their edges towards the center of the cave, further
than those they rest upon, and so one course above another
approaching nearer towards the middle, form all together a rude
kind of arch, by way of roof, over the vault below; this arch is
closed at top by one large stone that covers the center, and keeps
all fixt and compact together: for through the whole work appears
no sign of morter, clay, or other cement, to join or make its parts
lye firm and close, but where a crevise happens, or an interstice,
they are filled up with thin flat stones, split and wedged in, on
purpose with that design.</p>

<p>The bottom of the cave and entry is a rude sort of pavement,
made of the same stones of which the mount is composed, not
beaten or joined together, but loosely cast upon the ground only to
cover it. Along the middle of the cave, a slender quarrey-stone,
five or six foot long, lies on the floor, shaped like a pyramid, that
once, as I imagine, stood upright, perhaps a central stone to those
placed round the outside of the mount; but now 'tis fallen down....</p>

<p>When first the cave was opened, the bones of two dead bodies
entire, not burnt, were found upon the floor....</p>

<p>In each of the three cells was placed upon the ground a broad
and shallow cistern, somewhat round, but rudely formed out of a
kind of free-stone; they all were rounded a little at the bottom so
as to be convex, and at the top were slightly hollowed, but their
cavities contained but little; some of their brims or edges were
sinuated or scolopt, the diameter of these cisterns was more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
two foot wide, and in their height they measured about eighteen
inches from the floor.</p>

<p>The cell that lay upon the right hand was larger, and seemed
more regular and finish'd than the rest; for rude as it was, it shewed
the workman had spent more of his wild art and pains upon it, than
the other two: the cistern it contained was better shaped, and in
the middle of it was placed another smaller cistern, better wrought,
and of a more curious make; and still, for greater ornament, the
stone that lay along as lintal, o'er the entrance of this cell, was cut
with many spiral, circular, and waved lines, that with their rude and
shallow traces, covered the surface of the stone. This barbarous
kind of carving I observed in many other places of this cave,
promiscuously disposed of here and there, without the least rule or
order; but it was exprest no where with so much industry and
profuseness, as on the stones belonging to this cell: yet tho' they
were so lavish of their art, not the least footsteps of writing, or any
thing like characters were found in the whole work....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But the true genuine figure of the cave, and the description of
the niches in its sides, and the long entry leading to it, will be far
better understood by a plan which Mr. <i>Samuel Molyneux</i>, a young
gentleman of the college of <i>Dublin</i>, delineated with care and
accuracy, upon the place, last summer.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

the great flag-stones that make the sides or wall both of the cave

mounts, and so may be some mark or direction to find out the
hidden entrance, to other sepulchres of this kind, further enquiry
may inform us.</p>

<p>Figure the 7th [reproduced p. 126, <i>ante</i>] shows more particularly

stone, the artist has exprest abundance of rude barbarous sort of

altar raised upon it."</p>

<p>Dr. Molyneux also describes "two <i>Roman</i> golden coins" (Llhwyd
only mentions <i>one</i>) which "about ten or twelve years since" were
found "near the surface," on the exterior of the mound; but these
have practically as little to do with the structure itself as if they had
been found in the neighbouring meadow.</p>

<p>In comparing these two eighteenth-century accounts, one observes
a few points calling for observation. But, before referring particularly
to these, it may be convenient to add some of the statements
made by Col. Forbes-Leslie with regard to the same mound. This
writer, in his "Early Races of Scotland" (Edin., 1866, Vol. II.,
pp. 331-341), makes several interesting remarks upon the mound of
New Grange, and others of a similar nature, and among his illustrations
are two of New Grange, drawn by himself. These, however,
do not supply any additional information. On the subject of this
and similar mounds, Colonel Leslie remarks thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Neither historical evidence, nor that derived from an examination
of these monuments, appears sufficient warrant for the decision
that all these chambers were exclusively intended for places of
sepulture. Certainly in some of these chambers the massive materials
used in their construction have apparently been designed and
employed for other purposes. The following questions are suggested
by peculiarities in these specimens of chambered tumuli&mdash;Were
they intended to be occupied by the living, or as sepulchres for the
dead? Were they originally used as temples, and afterwards turned
into tombs? Or, on the contrary, although raised for tombs, were
they afterwards used as habitations?...</p>

<p>"An examination of the remarkable tumuli above mentioned
gives rise to the above questions, and they are not answered by any
theories or explanations regarding these monuments which have yet
been offered to the public. It may be admitted, although it cannot
be proved, that all or most of these monuments have at some period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
been used as sepulchres, and that the mound of stones or earth in
which they are enveloped is sepulchral." But, in a foot-note, Col.
Leslie adds: "There is no authentic record of human remains
having been discovered either in New Grange, in the tumulus of
Gavr-Innis [Brittany], or in that of Maeshow."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"What are usually called sarcophagi in the chamber at New
Grange may more correctly be designated as very shallow trays of a
circular or rather oval form. In the eastern recess there are two&mdash;one
placed above another of somewhat larger dimensions, the uppermost
being 3 feet long. The position and appearance of all of
them are very unlike anything intended for the reception of sepulchral
deposits."</p>

<p>... "New Grange cairn is about 70 feet in height, and is said
to cover an area nearly two acres in extent. Composed of loose
stones, slightly covered with earth and partly overgrown with trees,
this mound formerly had little appearance of being artificial, except
that at a few yards' distance it was encircled by a line of single
stones of great size fixed upright in the ground. The entrance to
the chamber in this mound was accidentally discovered in 1699 by
labourers who were removing stones to repair a neighbouring
road."...</p>

<p>"In each of the three recesses of the chamber were the shallow
trays already mentioned, which by different writers have been
variously designated as 'basins,' 'rude bowls,' 'urns,' 'typical urns,'
'sarcophagi.'<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> There was one in the northern and one in the
western recess, but the most remarkable are two in the eastern
recess. The uppermost of these is somewhat oval in shape, slightly
concave on its surface, and 3 feet in length: in it are two small
artificial cavities. This tray lies on another, which is rather larger
and less concave than that which rests on it. The tray in the
western recess, although but slightly hollowed, has a well-defined
rim on the edge of the upper surface....</p>

<p>"New Grange was first described by Edward Llhuyd the antiquary,
who, writing in 1699, makes no mention of any human
remains being found in it, but notes 'a great many bones of beasts
and some pieces of deers' horns' lying under foot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
It will be seen that these accounts vary in several respects. One
curious discrepancy is that relating to the shallow stone "trays" in
the recesses of the central chamber. Dr. Molyneux states that the
northern recess contained one of these, and his young namesake
shows such a "tray" in his plan; and yet Llhwyd, writing twenty-five
years earlier, distinctly says that "in the apartment straight
forward there was none at all." That this is the case at the present
day will be seen from the plan by Mr. W. F. Wakeman. It is
noteworthy that Colonel Leslie also gives the number as three; but
he speaks in the past tense when referring to the north recess, and
he probably only echoes Molyneux. But Llhwyd's statement is so
distinct that, considering his priority of date, his version must be
accepted as the true one, in spite of the fact that young Molyneux
(who, although he is stated to have drawn his plan "on the place,"
may have supplemented it from memory) represents the inner
"apartment" as occupied by one of those "trays."</p>

<p>As for the theories of the two earlier writers, on the subject of
the origin and purpose of this "mount," it will be observed they
differ widely. Molyneux has no doubt about its being the work of
the ninth-century Danes, while Llhwyd, arguing from the discovery
of Roman coins on the outer crust, infers that it was erected by
"the ancient Irish." Although the coins cannot be held to constitute
a strong reason for accepting Llhwyd's conclusions, other good
grounds for doing so are obvious to every reader of the foregoing
pages.</p>

<p>Again, while Molyneux states very definitely that "when first
the cave was opened, the bones of two dead bodies entire, not
burnt, were found upon the floor," Llhwyd merely remarks that
"they found several bones in the cave, and part of a stag's (or else
elk's) head, and some other things," and Forbes-Leslie asserts that
"there is no authentic record of human remains having been discovered"
in this chambered mound.</p>

<p>All of the writers quoted differ also as to the uses to which this
structure was put. It was "some place of sacrifice or burial,"
according to Llhwyd; Molyneux is sure that it was a "sepulchre";
and Forbes-Leslie regards the whole matter as undecided. But,
although the last-named writer is of opinion that this, and similar
mounds, may have been dwellings, he nevertheless admits that
undoubtedly many of them, if not all, have also been used as
places of burial. And these two beliefs are quite reconcilable,
if one accepts what Professor Boyd Dawkins refers to as "the
hypothesis of the origin of chambered tombs invented by Prof.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Nilsson." "Chambered tombs, according to that great authority,
were originally the subterranean houses in which the deceased
lived, and there the dead were laid literally each 'in his own
house.'" Whether human skeletons were really found in "the
Brugh of the Boyne" or not, it seems clear that the mound at
Dowth was ultimately, at any rate, a place of sepulture. "The
most remarkable difference" between it and its more famous
neighbour was, says Colonel Leslie, "that in Dowth fragments of
burned human bones were discovered." And it is to be noted that
tradition speaks of this place as "the cave (or 'weem') of the <i>grave</i>
of Bodan, above Dowth:" (<i>Uaimh Feirt Bodan os Dubath</i>). Dowth,
or Dubath, may have denoted the mound itself; in which case the
word signifying "above" or "upon" might refer to an exterior burial,
in the "crust" of the mound, of which there are many examples.
For instance, although tradition speaks of the Inverness <i>Tomnahurich</i>
as an inhabited "brugh," yet its exterior was used as a
place of burial at a very early date, as is testified by the discovery,
a few years ago, of a stone "kist," containing a human skeleton,
buried some feet below the surface of the mound.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> However, the
word <i>Dubath</i> (conjectured on a previous page to have signified
<i>dubh-ath</i>, "the black ford") probably did not originally denote the
mound itself, and <i>it</i> therefore was "above Dubath," and the central
chamber of the mound constituted "the weem of the grave of
Bodan," who was presumably the owner of the "burned human
bones" referred to by Colonel Leslie.</p>

<p>But, while a description of the "Brugh of the Boyne" would be
very imperfect without a reference to the subject of burial in chambered
mounds, the various traditions which have been collected in
these pages (themselves a minute fraction of the whole) show that
such mounds, whatever their secondary use, are pre-eminently
distinguished in the memory of the people as the <i>dwelling-places</i> of
a certain peculiar "underground" race.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_B" id="APPENDIX_B"></a>APPENDIX B.</h2>


<h3>THE SKRÆLINGS.</h3>

<p>There are many references to the North American Skrælings in
Rafn's great work entitled "Antiquitates Americanæ: sive Scriptores
Septentrionales Rerum Ante-Columbianarum in America," published
under the auspices of the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries
(Copenhagen, 1837). This is a collection of the accounts in the old
Northern chronicles, relating to the Northmen's (<i>gamle Nordboers</i>)
voyages of discovery to America, between the tenth and fourteenth
centuries. And from these accounts it is seen that the tribes then
inhabiting the territories on either side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
and as far south as Massachusetts, were the Skrælings; with whom
the Northmen occasionally fought, and at other times traded, giving
them pieces of red cloth in exchange for furs.</p>

<p>That the term by which they are chiefly known to modern writers
was not the only one given to them by the Northmen is seen from a
remark made by one of the chroniclers of Thorfinn Karlsefne, who
states that "these people are called Lapps in some books (<i>thær
thjódhir kalla sumir bækr Lappa</i>)."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> On the other hand, the map
of Olaus Magnus, referred to in the foregoing pages, shows that the
northern corner of Norway was then inhabited by a race of <i>Scric-Finni</i>,
"commonly called 'Screlings,'" who at least were the
neighbours of Lapps.</p>

<p>In connection with the North American "Lapps" or "Skrælings,"
the editor of <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i> supplies the following note
(p. 45):&mdash;"Skrælingos appellatos autumat Bussæus ob humilem
staturam; quam ob rem et interdum ab Islandis <i>Smælíngjar</i> (homunculi)
audiunt. Hæc vero communis appellationis ratio vix
esse potest. Arnas Magnæus in collectaneis ad novam editionem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Schedarum Arii polyhistoris, vocem <i>Skrælíngjar</i> interpretatur errones,
incertum qua ratione, cum ipse nullam attulerit. Suhmius
(<i>Kjöbenhavnske Selskabs Skrifter</i>, VIII., pag. 81) eos ita propter
vilem armaturam appellatos putat. Nonne potius nomen istud ob
ora macilenta adepti sunt, ab <i>at skræla</i>, arefacere? Nota, Petrum
Clausenium Undalinum, in descriptione Norvegiæ, ed. Hafn. 1632,
pag. 375-6, hoc nomen scribere <i>Skregklinge</i> et <i>Skreglinge</i>, qs. a
<i>skrækja</i>, clamare, ejulare, cfr. Partic. de Karlsefnio, cap. 10
infra."</p>

<p>Whatever may be the etymology of this word (which in some of
its forms approaches the "<i>Scric</i>-Finni" of Norway), it is quite
clear from the <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i> that those tenth-century
natives of what is now New England and New Brunswick strongly
resembled the modern Eskimos. "Hæc descriptio Skrælingorum
accurate quadrat in hodiernos Grænlandos sive Eskimoos," is the
observation made by the editor (p. 149, <i>n</i>.) on a description of some
of those people encountered by the Northmen. And, similarly, the
note relative to their skin-canoes, or kayaks, is as follows:<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>&mdash;"<i>húdhkeipr</i>,
species navigii, acatium coriaceum vel corio contextum,
quo usi sunt indigenæ, ut etiamnunc Grænlandi ex genere Eskimoorum;
itaque per carabum redditum, qui secundum Isidorum
Hispal. in Orig. Libr. 19, cap. 1. est 'parva scapha ex vimine facta,
qui contexta crudo corio genus navigii præbet.'&mdash;Vocem illustrat vir
doctissimus Gunnar Pauli, f. in annotationibus, insertis indici vocum
<i>Orkneyinga sagæ: 'Húdhkeipr</i>, navis sutilis, vel, si mavis, corio
obducta vel circumdata. Nam phocarum ad hunc usum pelles adhibere
Grænlandos notum est, quorum naves <i>húdhkeipar</i> nostratibus
olim sunt appellatæ.'"</p>

<p>In these references there is much that is suggestive. One would
like to know the occasions on which the Latin term "acatium" was
used; and also the circumstances which induced an editor of the
<i>Orkneyinga Saga</i> to enlarge upon the appearance of the <i>húdhkeipr</i>.
Taken in connection with the existence of kayak-using Finnmen, in
the Orkney Isles, less than two centuries ago, this latter allusion is
very striking. Similarly, an explanation of the term "Skregklinge"
or "Skreglinge," occurring in a description of <i>Norway</i>, of the year
1632 (above referred to), arouses equal interest in that work.</p>

<p>That the Skrælings, wherever situated, were "pigmies," is evident
from the testimony of Olaus Magnus,&mdash;and the accounts of the
eleventh-century Northmen fully corroborate this. One of their
references is as follows: "They were small, ugly men, with horrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
heads of hair, great eyes, and broad cheek-bones: (<i>Their voru smáir
menn ok illiligir, ok íllt höfdhu their hár á höfdhi, eygdhir voru their
mjök ok breidhir í kinnunum</i>)."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Another description occurs in the
<i>Saga of Thorfinn Karlsefne</i> which relates how, in the year 1011 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
(three years after his first encounter with the American Skrælings),
he and his people arrived at Markland,&mdash;a country identified with
the modern New Brunswick and other lands lying round the Gulf of
St. Lawrence. Here they encountered five Skrælings, one man, two
women and two boys: ("... <i>ok funnu thar Skrælingja 5, ok
var einn skeggiadhr; konur voru 2, ok börn tvö</i>;" in which passage it
may be noted that the man was distinguished by the term "bearded,"&mdash;<i>skeggjadhr</i>).
They captured the two boys, "but the others
escaped, and sank beneath the ground:" ("<i>Verosimile est, Skrælingos
in cavernas subterraneas se abdidisse</i>," is the explanation given by the
commentator in <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>).<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> Karlsefne's people took
the boys away with them, had them baptized, and taught them
Icelandic. These stated that their father and mother (no doubt,
the "bearded one" and one of the two women, then lamenting
them in their underground dwelling) were respectively named
Uvæge and Vethillde;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and that their people had no houses, but
lived in dens and caves: ("<i>í hellum edha holum</i>"). The country
of the Skrælings, they said, was governed by two kings or chiefs,
one named Avalldamon (or Avalldumon) and the other Valldidida."</p>

<p>It will be seen from these references that although those
Skrælings of nine centuries ago are rightly regarded as probable
progenitors of modern Eskimos, there were some differences between
the two. The term "shaggy" or "bearded," used to
distinguish the man from his two female companions, certainly does
not indicate that the latter were themselves hirsute. But the
previous reference to the "ugly" or "horrible" heads of hair,
and the description of their eyes as very large, are two points
that seem to denote a race not wholly identical with modern Eskimos.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Moreover, the rapid disappearance of the adults underground,
on the occasion when the two boys were captured, is more
suggestive of the dwarfs of tradition (such as those who similarly
escaped from Suafurlami when he attempted to smite them with
his magic sword) than of the Greenlanders of to-day.</p>

<p>Although the accounts of the two boy prisoners might be held to
denote that the manners they described were new to the Northmen,
yet an incident of earlier date shows clearly that the latter quite
understood the subterranean ideas of those North American
"Lapps." The incident referred to is this: In the year 1004,
Thorwald Ericson and his followers had surprised a small party
of nine Skrælings at the entrance to Plymouth Harbour, on the
coast of Massachusetts,<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> and of these they killed eight. The
ninth sped away in his skin-canoe to the inner end of the bay,
out of which there presently emerged an infuriated swarm of
kayakkers. But before they appeared, the Northmen had had time
to note a group of "hillocks" on the beach (apparently on the
interior curve of the promontory terminating in the modern "Gurnet
Point,") and these "hillocks" they assumed to be the abodes
of the Skrælings.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> This was seven years before the capture of the
boys by Karlsefne's party, and the inference clearly is that they
were accustomed to regard kayak-using dwarfs as mound-dwellers.
Indeed, the very fact that they styled the natives "Lapps" and
"goblins,"<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> as well as Skrælings, shows that they regarded them
as belonging to the same race as similar people well known to
them in Europe.</p>

"<i>Fens</i> Fiord." Bergen is so much associated with the
"Finns" of Shetlandic tradition that it is at least
worthy of notice that a special caste, known as <i>Strils</i>
(pronounced "Streels"), who are very primitive in
character, and who are regarded by the neighbouring
Norwegians as of a different stock from their own, still
inhabit the numerous islands that protect Bergen from the
ocean. "They speak Norwegian after a fashion of their
own, but it is very difficult to understand them, and
there is reason to suppose that their idioms have a
Samoyede root." ("Bergen," by Lieut. G. T. Temple, R.N.,
in <i>Good Words</i>, 1880, p. 767 <i>et seq.</i>)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> A recent visitor to the Greenland branch of that
family states that "a skilled Eskimo can, in his kayak,
go even eighty miles in one day." The length of the day
is, of course, an important matter. Dr. Nansen, the
traveller referred to (who made the above statement in
his paper read before the Scottish Geographical Society
at Edinburgh on 1st July, 1889) gained his experience of
kayaks during winter, when the Greenland day is very
short. If the eighty miles were done <i>then</i>, the speed is
marvellous. It is so, indeed, in any case. When Dr.
Nansen reached Godthaab in October, the nearest
Europe-bound ship was lying at a place 240 miles to the
south, and a "kayaker" was despatched thither to try and
detain the vessel, which was to sail in the middle of the
month. Though unsuccessful in his mission, he reached the
vessel in plenty of time. The dates of his journey are
not given. But the mere fact of the man being thus sent
as an express messenger argues that a very high rate of
speed was relied upon.</p></div>

a "peculiar waterproof coat called a camalinkie, made
from the entrails of the seal, and is nearly as fine as
tissue paper, almost every inch of it being quilted, to
strengthen it. The Aleut wears this curious garment when
seated in his canoe." ("Seal Hunting in Behring Sea";

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> It is an unfortunate circumstance that, owing to the
lamentable indifference of the custodiers of the
Finnman's canoe subsequent to the year 1696, it seems
impossible to say whether or not that vessel is still
preserved. In 1865 the Edinburgh Museum of Science and
Art became possessed of the collection of the University,
and in that collection were two kayaks, with regard to
which nothing definite was known at the time of
transference. If the University "preserved" the Finnman's
kayak, as the College of Physicians expected, then it
must be one of these two, as these were the only kayaks
in the University Museum in 1865. (In the hope of
obtaining a definite solution of this question, I have
given a description of that kayak which appears to be the
most likely to be the Finnman's, in a paper read before
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland on 10th February,
1890.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a>
This peculiar feat is mentioned by Drs. Rink and
Nansen, as well as in connection with the Greenlander of
1816. Another "kayak" custom may here be noticed. Brand
stated of the Orkney Finn-man, that "when in a storm he
seeth the high surge of a wave approaching, he hath a way
of sinking his Boat, till the wave pass over, least
thereby he should be overturned." This manifestly does
not refer to the deliberate overturning for amusement, in
calm weather. But Hans Egede, in describing the Eskimo
kayakers of Greenland, during the eighteenth century, is
evidently speaking of the usage referred to by Brand,
when he says: "They do not fear venturing out to sea in
these boats in the greatest storms; because they can swim
as light upon the largest waves as a bird can fly: and
when the waves come upon them with all their fury, they
only turn the side of the boat towards them, to let them
pass, without the least danger of being sunk." (Quoted in
the <i>Scots Magazine</i> of 1816, p. 654.)</p></div>

the same as the Hesperides, Dr. Skene again shows that
the locality referred to is the Iberian coast. For the
writers of the second and sixth century whom he quotes
state that the Hesperides are inhabited by Iberians, and
are situated "near the sacred promontory where they say
is the end of Europe." Now, in Ptolemy's map, above
referred to, "the sacred promontory" (<i>Sacrum
Prom&#0333;tori&#0363;</i>) is Cape St. Vincent; which would place
the Hesperides at even a greater distance from England
than the Oestrymnic Isles. The islands called
<i>Londobries</i> and <i>Deorum Insulæ</i> on Ptolemy's map may be
those referred to. Neither they nor the Oestrymnic Isles
exist at the present day; but in questions of ancient
history the fact ought never to be overlooked that the
surface of the earth is constantly undergoing
changes,&mdash;at one place the sea encroaching upon the land,
at another retiring from it.</p></div>

Fin-boats" is used, I had assumed that these two vessels
were really large open skin-boats, like those of the
British Islanders and the Eskimos. But I am indebted to
Dr. Joseph Anderson for pointing out that the passage
distinctly states that the boats were of wood, and that
the allusion is to the "sewing" alone. As an article
contributed by me to the <i>Archæological Review</i> (Vol.
IV., Aug. 1889) contains this erroneous assumption, I
take this opportunity of stating that my inference is
contradicted by the original passage, with which I was
not then acquainted. Additional references, however,

and the inference is that, ethnologically regarded, these
were totally different from the others. It must be
remembered that the mere surname, borne by all the
members of a Highland clan, did not imply kinship. The
word "clan" was originally used to denote only the
blood-relations of the chief; but latterly it was applied
to the whole community. And that the commonalty was
frequently composed of men of a wholly different stock
from their chiefs may be seen from the fact that the
former are specially distinguished as "the native men"
(<i>i.e.</i>, aborigines) in several clan documents.</p></div>

instead of "Fin" in these two instances, as also in the
following chapter, where "the cunning of the Fin woman"
is referred to. But the admirable edition of 1889 employs
"Fin" in each case. Whatever may have been the original

"The Orkneys and Shetland" (London, 1883), indicates (p.

as the scene of Halfdan's death; and suggests that one of
"three curious ridges, or mounds" is probably that raised
over Halfdan's body. The saga certainly says that his
death took place on that island. But, of course, there is
plenty of room for conjecture in the whole story.</p></div>

Scotland," i, 311-312. It is not out of place to refer
here to a Mongoloid race of "Flat-noses" of whom Mr.
Howorth speaks. These are the Nogais, who are known as
"Manguts"; the word <i>Mangut</i>, or <i>Mangutah</i>, being
"merely an appellative, meaning flat-nosed." "Dr. Clark
says of them: 'They are a very different people from the
Tartars of the Crimea, and may be instantly distinguished
by their diminutive form, and the dark copper colour of
their complexion, sometimes almost black. They have a
remarkable resemblance to the Laplanders, although their
dress and manner has a more savage character.' Pallas
enlarges also upon their specially Mongolian features.
Klaproth says: 'Of all the Tartar tribes that I have
seen, the Nogais bear by far the strongest resemblance in
features and figure to the Mongols'" (Howorth's "History
of the Mongols," part ii, p. 2, and part iii, p. 71).</p></div>

other, we may at once reject it. The compound "Fingalian"
has also little to recommend it.</p></div>

regarding a race of sea-rovers, styled <i>Fomorians</i>; which
word is by some believed to be a latinized form of a
Gaelic term denoting a seafaring people. As it is not
improbable that this may be simply another name for the
people now under consideration, the following is worth
citing here: "That those adventurers whom our writers
call Fomorians, have arrived hither in multitudes from
that country whence the Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians
came, is a circumstance that may be collected from this
account, that the father-in-law of Tuathal is said, in
the genealogy of the kings of Ireland, to have been king
of the Fomorians of Finland." (O'Flaherty's "Ogygia,"

already referred to, remarks ("Woman in Early Ireland,"
<i>Century Magazine</i>, July 1889, p. 439): "Although in the
Kalewala the tribes of Pohjola, or the Lapps, are
considered foul magicians, and ever the foe of the heroes
of Kaleva, or the Finns, yet it is from Pohjola that
Waïnamoïnen and his comrades always take their brides by
force or by purchase." This quotation not only confirms
the above account of M. Tuchmann, but it also illustrates
the fact that even the most antagonistic races do not
refrain from mixing their blood. Thus it may be seen how
Lapps and Finns could eventually become almost
identified. And the "Heimskringla" shows us how, in turn,
this composite Finno-Lapp race could later on become
blended with that of the Haralds and Sigurds of the
Sagas.</p></div>

This definition is very convenient, and saves much
confusion. In spite, however, of the great difference
that Mr. Petrie speaks of as between the so-called
"Pictish" broch and the humbler dwelling that alone is
recognized by him as a "Pict's house," it is yet evident
that the "broch" is to a very great extent evolved from
the more primitive and rudimentary "Pict's house."</p></div>

"Reginald of Durham, writing in the last half of the
twelfth century, mentions, in 1164, Kirkcudbright as
being in 'terra Pictorum,' and calls their language
'sermo Pictorum.'" (<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 203, <i>note</i>.) Dr.
Skene, quoting various authorities, gives us an
interesting description of the Scottish army at the
Battle of the Standard. It was composed, we learn, of
Normans, Germans, English, Northumbrians, Cumbrians, men
of Teviotdale and the Lothians, Picts (commonly called
Galloways or Galloway-men), and Scots. This is the
statement made by Richard of Hexham, a contemporary
writer, and it seems to agree on the whole with the other
accounts. His "Cumbrians" are identified with the "Welsh"
of Strathclyde. No doubt his "Northumbrians" were those
who, living on the north of the Border, belonged to that
part of Northumbria which had then been Scottish for more
than a century. The Galloway Picts, it may be added, were
in the front of the battle, and "claimed to lead the van
as their right."</p></div>

by men who stood in a row and handed the stones from one
to the other is quite familiar to me with regard to
buildings in Ireland," writes a correspondent (the Rev.
J. Ffrench, of Clonegal, Fellow of the Royal Society of
Antiquaries of Ireland); and he furnishes one
example:&mdash;"Brash, in his 'Ecclesiastical Architecture of
Ireland,' when describing the Round Tower of <i>Ardmore</i>,
tells us: 'I have before stated that the materials of
which this tower was built were brought from the Mountain
of Slieve-Grian, some four or five miles distant. The
local legend is that the stones were brought to the spot
without "horse or wheel," and laid without the noise of a
hammer, the meaning of which is that the stones were all
dressed in the quarry, and a line of men being stationed
along from the quarry to the tower, the stones were
handed from one to the other.'"
</p><p>
While this Irish tradition does not identify these
builders with any special race of men, it is noteworthy
that their method of building is that which Scottish
tradition regards as peculiarly characteristic of the
Picts, or "Pechts." Moreover, the building referred to by
Brash is of precisely the same order as the Round Tower
of Abernethy, said to have been built after the same
fashion. And the builders of the Round Tower of
Abernethy, as also the builders of the Round Tower of
Brechin, are alleged by local tradition to have been
"Pechts."</p></div>

to those of the northern Eskimos, it is perhaps too much
to assume that the dwellings of the former admitted
nothing of the light of day. Mr. Petrie states that the
walls of the Pechts' houses "converge towards the top,
where they approach so closely that the aperture can be
spanned by a stone a couple of feet in length." If this
aperture remained open during the day, which seems quite
likely, then the above reference as to the ever-burning
lamp is only applicable to the dwellings of the northern
Greenlanders. For the sake of safety, while their lands
were over-run by hostile forces, it is probable that the
Pechts did cover the two-foot hole in the roof with a
large stone, which itself would need to be hidden by
earth and turf. But the fact that such an aperture was
left in the building indicates that it was frequently
uncovered; perhaps always at night, and also, during
times of safety, in the day. In the latter case, the
interior of this underground dwelling would thus receive,
through the hole overhead, enough light to fill the
central chamber with a sort of twilight, although the
smaller cells might have been quite in darkness.</p></div>

J. H. Todd, D.D. London, 1867, p. 115. In the above
quotation, the word translated "bronze" is <i>finndruine</i>.
This is referred to as "a metal, the constituents of
which are not well known. O'Clery describes it as <i>prás
go n-airgead buailte</i>, 'brass, with silver hammered on to
it.'" It is also referred to as "white silver," "silver
or white bronze," "brass," and "copper." It was employed
to furnish such various articles as "leg armour," the rim
of a shield, a royal chessboard, and, further, a
bedstead&mdash;which surely ought to have been royal also.
(<i>Op. cit.</i>, pp. ciii-civ. <i>note</i>, and 50 and 94; also
Skene's "Celtic Scotland," ii. 507.) The passage relating
to buffalo-horns is given in the Gaelic version ("War of
the Gaedhil," p. 114), "<i>ocus do chornaibh buabaill</i>."
The word <i>corn</i>, of which <i>chornaibh</i> is an inflection,
is substantially the Latin <i>cornu</i>. The Scotch-Gaelic
dictionaries give it chiefly the signification of
"drinking-horn," and "sounding-horn or trumpet."
Armstrong states that the drinking-cups of the northern
nations were made from the horns of the "urus or European
buffalo," referred to by Latin writers: He adds&mdash;"One of
these immense horns, at least an ox-horn of prodigious
size, is still preserved in the Castle of Dunvegan, Isle
of Sky." <i>Buabhall</i> itself has the secondary meaning of
"trumpet," or "cornet"; but its true meaning is
"buffalo." Armstrong subjoins these
comparisons&mdash;Armorican <i>bual</i>, French <i>bufle</i>, Latin
<i>bubulus</i>, Greek <i>boubalos</i>. Also Cornish <i>buaval</i>, with
the meaning of "trumpet." And also <i>buabhull-chorn</i>, "a
bugle-horn," with which he compares the Welsh
<i>bual-gorn</i>. Halliwell has <i>bougil</i>, "a bugle-horn," and
<i>bugle</i>, "a buffalo"; and with reference to the latter
spelling he says, "hence bugle-horn, a drinking-vessel
made of horn; also a hunting-horn." Professor Skeat, who
cites Halliwell also, defines "bugle" as "a wild ox." It
is clear that these are all merely variants of one word,
or rather of two words. The <i>u</i> in "bugle" has originally
been broad. The hard <i>c</i> of "corn" has become a guttural
in "chorn," and a mere aspirate in "horn," although it is
still found as "corn" both in English and Gaelic
dictionaries (with a very restricted meaning in the
former instance).</p></div>

to another instance in which these terms occur,
says:&mdash;"The words here used, <i>Dún</i>, <i>Daingen</i>, <i>Dingna</i>,
all signify a fort or fortress. It is not easy to define
the precise difference between them. <i>Dún</i> ... seems to
signify a fortified hill or mound. <i>Daingen</i> (dungeon) is
a walled fort or strong tower; hence <i>daingnigim</i>, I
fortify. <i>Dingna</i> [which he translates 'mound' in the
above instance] is apparently only another form of the
same word. Cf. 'Zeuss,' p. 30<i>n</i>.</p></div>

denote the "conical hill" of the fairies. <i>Talmhainn</i> is

<i>tolman</i> particularly denotes "a mound." And it, or the
variant <i>tulman</i>, is used in a fairy tale of the island
of Barra (Campbell's "West Highland Tales," ii. 39) with
special reference to one of those abodes of the "little
people." It may be added that the word translated the
"solitudes" of the Feens, etc., might also be rendered
the "secret places" or "concealed places."</p></div>

contributed to the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> of August 1882,
the following is stated with regard to the traditions of
this part of Lincolnshire:&mdash;"Ghosts, bogies, and the
supernatural generally have utterly vanished from this
commonplace district before schools and newspapers. Even
an old lady more than ninety years old said to us,
'Fairies and shag-boys! lasses are often skeart at them,
but I never saw none, though I have passed many a time
after dark a most terrible spot for them on the road at
Thorpe.'" The identity of "shag-boy" with "hog-boy" (as
used in Orkney) is asserted by the writer of the
<i>Cornhill</i> article; who also states:&mdash;"In an adjoining
field [near Beelsby] lingers one of the few legends of
this prosaic district. A treasure is supposed to be
hidden in it, and at times two little men, wearing red
caps, something like the Irish <i>leprechauns</i>, may be seen
intently digging for it." These little "red-caps" are not
identified with the "shag-boys," but popular tradition
generally would pronounce them to be the same people.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_184_184" id="Footnote_184_184"></a><a href="#FNanchor_184_184"><span class="label">[184]</span></a> One is apt to talk of this introductory passage as
though it had actually <i>penetrated</i> a previously existing
mound. But the construction of all those chambered mounds
shows plainly that the original stone structure, not only
the central building but the long passage of approach,
was originally reared upon the surface of the level
ground, in the open air. And that the "fairy hillock" had
no existence at all until the builders of the stone
structure had heaped above it all&mdash;chamber and
gallery&mdash;the mass of earth and stones that afterwards
transformed the whole exterior into a "green hillock,"
and thus completely disguised its real nature from all
but the initiated.</p></div>

"Early Races of Scotland," vol. ii. pp. 338-40.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_186_186" id="Footnote_186_186"></a><a href="#FNanchor_186_186"><span class="label">[186]</span></a> Even with this roof-light the interior of the
dwelling can only have received a limited supply of
daylight. And this explains the statement made by a
Scotch peasant who was taken by a "fairy" woman into her
abode. "Being asked by the judge [before whom he was
tried for 'witchcraft'] whether the place within the
hill, which he called a hall, were light or dark, he said
'<i>Indifferent, as it is with us in the twilight</i>.'"
</p><p>
At night, when the abode of the "hillmen" was lit up with
the glow of the fire, the cavity above the building, and
the atmosphere overhead, must have also received some
share of the firelight. This would account for the
statement made by Wallace (who wrote at the period when
"Evil Spirits also called Fairies" were "frequently seen
in several of the [Orkney] Isles dancing and making
merry,") to the effect that, "in the Parish of Evie, near
the Sea, are some small <i>Hillocks</i>, which frequently, in
the Night time, appear all in a fire." And when Mrs.
Ewing, in her "Old-Fashioned Fairy Tales," says that
<i>shian</i> is "a Gaelic name for fairy towers, which <i>by
day</i> are not to be told from mountain crags," she
evidently alludes to the same feature.</p></div>

It may be added that one feature in the first of the
Maes-how diagrams conveys a wrong impression of the
probable appearance of the mound, when inhabited; because
the "well or pit" ("or crater") is represented as being
as solid as the rest of the outer covering. That it
gradually became filled up with drift and rubbish, after
the dwelling ceased to be occupied, is evident. But when
the edifice was newly reared, and as long as people
continued to inhabit it, the upper part of the mound was
probably a hollow shaft; admitting light and air into the
dwelling below; "carrying off the smoke of their fire;"
and occasionally serving as a way of ingress and egress.</p></div>

the "howe" of other parts of Scotland means a "hollow."
In fact, the story says that the foul water ran <i>down</i> to
the entrance of the dwarf's house, which was therefore
either an underground gallery of the kind referred to, or
else a chambered mound placed on a lower level than the
shepherd's cottage.</p></div>

is known all over Europe. A special instance has been
cited in these pages (p. 107, <i>ante</i>, note<sup>2</sup>, when "two
little men, wearing red caps" are remembered as "intently
digging" for their lost treasure, in a certain field in
Lincolnshire. Mr. J. F. Campbell, in drawing his
Fairy-Lapp parallel, says (<i>Tales</i>, Introd. cviii.):
"Fairies had hoards of treasure&mdash;so have Lapps. A man
died shortly before one of my Tana trips, and the whole
country side had been out searching for his buried wealth
in vain. Some years ago the old silver shops of Bergen
and Trondhjem overflowed with queer cups and spoons, and
rings, silver plates for waist belts, old plate that had
been hidden amongst the mountains, black old silver coins
that had not seen the light for years. I saw the plate
and bought some, and was told that, in consequence of a
religious movement, the Lapps had dug up and sold their
hoards." Another writer (A. de C. Brooke: <i>A Winter in
Lapland</i>, London, 1827, pp. 109-111), in referring to
this practice, says that sometimes the Lapp "forgets
himself where he has hidden it, and his hoard of silver
remains so effectually concealed, after he has been
absent some time, that he is unable to discover the
place, and it is consequently lost to him for ever." And
this writer refers to a Lapp of his acquaintance who had
concealed his treasure "so securely that, notwithstanding
the regular searches he had made for it," he could not
recover it. This feature offers an explanation of the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_247_247" id="Footnote_247_247"></a><a href="#FNanchor_247_247"><span class="label">[247]</span></a> Although the dwarfs of central England may not
rightly be considered under the name of Picts or Pechts,
a chain connecting them with the people thus called is
discernible. Scott says that, "according to romantic
tradition," Kenilworth "had been first tenanted" by
"those primitive Britons" who were "the soldiers of King
Arthur" ("Kenilworth," ch. xxvi). Thus, the early
inhabitants of Kenilworth are equally "fairies" and
"primitive Britons." Again, in Glamorganshire (according
to Mr. Wirt Sikes, "British Goblins," pp. 6 and 392),
there is "a certain steep and rugged crag" which bears "a
distinctly awful reputation as a stronghold of the fairy
tribe," and, in a secret cavern underneath this crag,
"Arthur and his warriors" are believed to be sleeping.
While an Edinburgh tradition, given by Dr. Daniel Wilson
("Memorials," vol. ii. ch. xix.), states that "King
Arthur and the Pechts" have also withdrawn to a
subterranean retreat in the hill which is still known as
Arthur's Seat. Obviously, Arthur, if he ever lived,
cannot have retired into all of these places, but there
is, nevertheless, a vague agreement in these three
traditions; and Kenilworth, Arthur's Seat, and Craig y
Ddinas all testify to an identification of Arthur and his
"primitive Britons," with the underground "fairies" and
"Pechts." It may be objected that the tradition of
Barbarossa, as in Rückert's ballad, asleep in his
underground castle, with his dwarf beside him, is
evidently of the same origin as those just referred to.
This is manifest. But, before attempting to reconcile
Continental with British tradition, it is important to
first demonstrate, if that may be done, that the British
traditions here spoken of are <i>historical</i> and not
<i>mythological</i>. (The story of the Kenilworth fairies will
be found at p. 218 of "The Dialect of the English
Gypsies," by B. C. Smart and H. T. Crofton, London,
1875.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_248_248" id="Footnote_248_248"></a><a href="#FNanchor_248_248"><span class="label">[248]</span></a> It is impossible to refer here to the many terms
used to denote what is really one class of people; as
these terms themselves show when analyzed. But this term
"goblin," although in recent centuries it has been
surrounded with much that is unreal and fictitious,
appears to have been once used in the most ordinary
matter-of-fact way. This will be seen from the following
reference quoted by Dr. Henry Rink ("Danish Greenland,"
1877, p. 16), in the narrative of a Norse visit to
Greenland in the eleventh century:&mdash;"One morning Thorgils
went out by himself on the ice, and discovered the
carcase of a whale in an opening, and beside two
'witches' (or 'goblins,' evidently Eskimo women), who
were tying large bundles of flesh together. Thorgils
instantly rushed upon one of them with his sword and cut
off one of her hands, whereupon both of them took to
their heels." In other words, the eleventh-century
natives of Greenland, whom Dr. Rink believes were
Eskimos, were at once classed by a Norwegian of that
period in the same category as those whom he had been
accustomed to call "goblins" in Europe.</p></div>

numerous. In Denmark alone, according to J. M. Thiele,
tradition points out as chambered mounds "two hills,
Mangelbierg and Gillesbierg, in the environs of
Hirschholm, on Hösterkiöb Mark": "a hill called
Wheel-hill, at Gudmandstrup, in the Lordship of Odd": "a
large knoll called Steensbierg, at Ouröe, near
Joegerspriis": "the high ridge on which the church
stands, at Kundebye, in the Bailiewick of Holbeck"; and,
in the same bailiewick, at a place between the towns of
Mamp and Aagerup, "near the Strand": Gultebierg also
supplies another to the list: while "between Jerslöse and
Söbierg, lies Söbierg bank, which is the richest knoll in
the land." (For similar references in this neighbourhood,
see also Mr. W. G. Black's "Heligoland.") And Thorpe's
"Northern Mythology" specifies many such mounds. M. Pol
de Mont (in his Flemish "Volkskunde," ii. 5, pp. 89-90)
points out an "Aschberg," at Casterlé, in the province of
Antwerp, which is said to have held fifty
<i>bergmannetjes</i>, or hill-dwarfs. (With this may fitly be
compared three Eskimo "mounds" at Hopedale, Labrador,
which, though they are now deserted, "more than one
hundred persons of both sexes and all ages are said to
have inhabited.") But every Continental "Venusberg," into
which men of the taller race were tempted by the
attractions of the dwarf women, and every "berg" that is
affirmed to have been the residence of a "berg-fee,"
comes under the same denomination as the special examples
already cited.</p></div>

Mollach is well known in the legendary history of the
Grants. Scott again refers to her in his Introduction to
"The Monastery," where he asserts that she "condescended
to mingle in ordinary sports, and even to direct the
Chief how to play at draughts." With this may be compared
Thorpe's statement ("Northern Mythology," I., 145) that
the Scandinavian dwarfs, who were also hairy, used to
"play at tables." There is also a story in the Island of
Skye of a "brownie" who watched over and instructed one
of the players in a game of "tables." (<i>See</i> Defoe's
"Duncan Campbell," London, 1856, p. 106.) "Tables" seems
to have been a comprehensive name for draughts, chess,
and other games played on a chess-board; and these
remarks recall the set of chessmen, carved out of walrus
tusk, already referred to as having been found in the
Hebrides in 1826, and of which eleven are in the Museum
of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. "Chess-playing
was one of the favourite amusements of the Irish
chieftains," says O'Donovan ("Book of Rights," Dublin,
1847, p. lxi), and he gives illustrations of an Irish
chess-man, which he states is exactly similar, "as well
in style as in material," to the Hebridean specimens just
mentioned.</p></div>

Murray, 1830, p. 115) that Rob Roy once gained a victory
by disguising a part of his men, by means of goat-skins,
as "ourisks," and so terrifying their opponents. But if
that Rob Roy, or any section of his followers, presented
the appearance which Scott himself portrays, or if any
remnant of the ancient "Pechts" survived in that
neighbourhood, it does not seem that any disguise was
necessary to give them the appearance of "wild, or shaggy
men."</p></div>

"Gwylliaid" by "Banditti," and never refers to them as

the derivation of the word itself, it seems clearly to be
connected with Welsh <i>coblyn</i>, English <i>goblin</i> and
<i>gub</i>, and Italian <i>gobbo</i>&mdash;pigmy. Compare also <i>gobban</i>

In Mr. Hunt's "Popular Romances of the West of England"
(London, J. C. Hotten, 2nd edit., pp. 217, 218), there is
a weird story of a wrestling-match by night, at a certain
cairn near Penzance. The wrestlers were believed by the
two onlookers to be supernatural beings:&mdash;"They were men
of great size and strength, with savage faces, rendered
more terrible by the masses of uncombed hair which hung
about them, and the colours with which they had painted
their cheeks." They had appeared to issue out of the
rocks of the cairn. Although the term "great size," if it
denotes <i>stature</i>, does not include these men among
dwarfs, yet they are represented as <i>Picti</i>; and as
"supernatural," hirsute cave-dwellers.</p></div>

picture by the artist. And another detail, which he has
introduced, has not been referred to in these pages,
viz., the miner's lamp worn by the dwarfs. In Cornwall,
the earliest miners are understood to have been those
"little people," whose subterranean habits would
undoubtedly render them early acquainted with the use of
metals. And the miner's lamp may reasonably be regarded
as an inheritance from the dwarf races. It is noteworthy
that the typical miner's dress, in seventeenth-century
England, appears to have been "canvas breeches, red
waistcoats and red caps," a garb closely in agreement
with some versions of the dwarf attire. (See Hone's
"Ancient Mysteries," p. 259.)</p></div>

But it is appropriate to notice that the "Arabian Nights"
tales are, in this respect, in keeping with those of the
West. For example, Schaibar, the brother of the fairy
Pari-Banou, is a powerful dwarf, possessing a tremendous
beard and moustache (his strength, the smallness of his
stature, and his beard are all vastly exaggerated, but
they are all distinguishing features). And again, in the
Third Voyage of Sindbad, his vessel approaches an island
of which he says:&mdash;"The captain told us that this island
was inhabited by hairy savages, who would come to attack
us; and although they were only dwarfs, we must not
attempt to make any resistance; for, as their number was
inconceivable, if we should happen to kill one, they
would pour upon us like locusts, and destroy us. No
sooner had he said this than we saw coming towards us an
innumerable multitude of hideous savages, entirely
covered with red hair, and about two feet high. They
threw themselves into the sea, and swam to the ship,
which they soon completely encompassed. They spoke to us
as they approached, but we could not understand their
language. They began to climb the sides and ropes of the
vessel with so much swiftness and agility, that their
feet scarcely seemed to touch them, and soon reached the
deck."</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
